<h3>What is Interactive Papers?</h3>
<p>
    Interactive Papers is a reader app for academic papers. You can view references without scrolling away or leaving the page, helping you stay focused on the content.
</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<h5>View Content</h5>
<p>On the top right corner, you should see an input field that says "Enter content name.." Enter the name of the content you wish to read there to view an interactive document.</p>
<h5>Viewing References</h5>
<p>
    References, or <em>"footnotes"</em> are marked in blue. Try clicking on the blue text at the end of this sentence, and its contents will appear at the bottom of the screen.
    <a>[1]</a> <br />
    Click on the "X" button on the bottom right corner of the screen to dismiss the footnote to return to your reading.
</p>

<h5>Finding Where a Footnote was Referenced in a Document</h5>
<p>All the footnotes for this content are located at the very bottom of this page. Clicking on the footnote will bring you to the point in the original text where the footnote is referenced.</p>

<h3>Tutotrial</h3>
<p>This tutorial will guide you through the basics of editing content for Interactive Papers. </p>

<h5>0. Preparations</h5>
<p>
    1) Create a folder anywhere on your computer with the name "your-name-title-of-your-work" (No spaces or special characters allowed).<a>[2]</a> This is the folder you will be submitting.<br>
    2) Inside, create 2 files, each called "content.html" and "footnotes.html". <br>
    3) Optionally, create a folder called "images".
</p>

<h5>1. Turning plain text to HTML</h5>

<p>Let's say you wrote the following text. For the computer to format the text correctly, we need to add HTML tags.</p>

    <div class="title">The Contranst/1792/Which is Best [1]</div>
    
    <p>
        War seemed imminent in 1792 Europe. The revolutionary ideals of France began to spread to other countries. Britain’s monarchy was shaky and it had everything to lose by losing ground to the Revolution. Therefore, in a war of ideology, Britain went to war against France. The Contrast leaflet is evidence of the rising liberalist movement in Britain. I will analyze the "The Contrast/Which is Best," in order to place the pamphlet in the historical context.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The leaflet features two figures, one representing a peaceful Britannia and the other a Medusa-like Marianne. The figure of Britannia wears a full dress with a red cape, but the more noticeable part is her helmet, spear and shield. The whole wardrobe is vaguely reminiscent of Athena, who, in Greek mythology, provides the main tool for Perseus to kill Medusa. Britannia also holds the scales in her left hand, a traditional symbol of justice. She holds the Magna Carta, the constitution of England in her right hand. To Britannia's right, a ship of the line proudly sits in the harbor, flaunting the power of the English navy. A golden lion sits at her feet, a symbol of the British monarchy. [2]

<p>Copy and paste your work into a text editor of your choice, and add &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot; tags as shown below, and &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; tags for each paragraph of your writing.</p>
<p>
1. The entire text should be surrounded in &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot; tags with the class of "student-submission". <br>
2. Author information (first 4 lines) should be surrounded in &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot; tags with the class of "author". <br>
3. Each paragraph should be wrapped in &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; tags. <br>
4. Insert &lt;br&gt; tags in place of line breaks within tags (such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;p&gt;) <br>

<h5>2. Add Footnotes to Writing</h5>
<p>Now, let's make the annotations clickable, or interactive. Surround footnote/endnote markers with &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; tags.<a>[3]</a></p>

<h5>3. Write Footnote Content</h5>
<p>Now, we need to write the actual contents of the footnotes. Open the "footnotes.html" file that you just created, and use the code template below to create contents for your footnotes.</p>

<p class="lead">Code (footnotes.html): </p>
<pre class="mt-0 mb-4"><code class="language-html"><!--<div class="footnote" id="[0]">
    You did it! This is a footnote. Click on the "X" on the far right corner to close this footnote.
</div>--></code></pre>
<p>The class attribute of the &lt;div&gt; should be "footnote", and the id attribute shoudl be the <strong>footnote ID</strong>. Anything can go into the contents of a footnote, including images and custom HTML code.</p>

<h5>Complete!</h5>
<p>Congratulations! Now you can create, edit, and customize your writing with annotations. Read more below for advanced tutorials, or type in 'sample' for the content name field in the navigation bar at the top of the screen for the full sample text.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<h5>Footnotes</h5>
<p>
    Each footnote has an <strong>ID</strong> (unique)<a>[4]</a>, <strong>display text</strong> and <strong>content</strong>.
</p>
<h6>Footnote ID</h6>
<p>
    A footnote <strong>ID</strong> can be anything, as long as it is: a) unique across a document, and b) plain text(no html code).<a>[4]</a>
</p>

<pre class="mt-0 mb-4"><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- Simplest form: footnote ID surrounde by &lt;a&gt; tags --&gt;
&lt;a&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Any unique, plaintext footnote ID is fine --&gt;
&lt;a&gt;001&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a&gt;[External Source 03]&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h6>Display Text</h6>
<p>By default, Interactive Paper assumes the <strong>display text</strong> is the footnote <strong>ID</strong>. If you want the <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>display text</strong> to be different (for instance, to custom style your annotations using HTML code), specify the footnote <strong>ID</strong> using the "data-ip-footnote-id" attribute in the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>
<pre class="mt-0 mb-4"><code class="language-html">&lt;!--Default: Display text (text between a tags) is the footnote name--&gt;
&lt;a&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- Custom Styling: Superscript --&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[5]"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!--Display text can be totally different from the footnote name --&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[6]"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Footnote 6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- Good (O) --&gt;

&lt;!--Display text doesn't have to be unique, only the name should be unique.--&gt;
&lt;!-- Case A: This is fine (O) --&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[7]"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[8]"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; 

&lt;!-- Case B: This causes an error. (X) --&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[9]"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a data-ip-footnote-id="[9]"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;     
</code></pre>

<p class="text-danger">[IMPORTANT] A footnote <strong>name</strong> must be unique(one and only) across an entire document.</p>

<h5>Inserting links (normal &lt;a&gt; tags)</h5>
<p>Interactive Paper assumes <strong>&lt;a&gt; tags without href and class attributes to be a footnote</strong>, and will process these as the web page is rendered to act as an internal footnote link. However, it is possible to use the traditional &lt;a&gt; tag with href specified to point it to an external link. If you specify a href attribute to an &lt;a&gt; tag, Interactive Papers will not process it as a footnote, but just treat it as a traditional link tag.</p>

<pre class="mt-0 mb-4"><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- This is considered as a footnote --&gt;
&lt;a&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;!-- This will be considered as an external link. --&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.someurl.com/some/good/source"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<h5>Inserting Images</h5>
<p>If your submission contains images, whether in your main text or your footnotes, create a folder called 'images' in your submissions folder and save all your images there.</p>

<h6>Use &lt;img&gt; tags</h6>
<p>Add the following code where you want your images to go.</p>
<pre class="mt-0 mb-4"><code class="language-html"><!--<img src="images/image_file_name.jpg" alt="image_file_name">--></code></pre>
<p>The 'src' attribute specifies the location and file name of the <strong>s</strong>ou<strong>r</strong><strong>c</strong>e image file. The 'alt' is text that is displayed <em>'alt'ernatively</em> when for some reason the computer cannot find the image file that you specified in the 'src' attribute. It can be the image file name, or it could be a short description of the image.</p>
<p><span class="text-danger"><strong>* The image file name must not contain any spaces or special characters.</strong></span><a>[5]</a></p>
