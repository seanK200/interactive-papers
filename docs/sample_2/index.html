                    <p><i><u>Women were the essential links in the Resistance.</u></i><a>[SU]</a> (Lucie Aubrac, 1997)</p>
 
<p>On the day of de Gaulle's appeal, 18 June 1940, <a data-ip-footnote-id="Jeanne-Bohec">Jeanne Bohec</a>, a 21-year-old who worked as a chemical assistant at a gunpowder factory in Brest, boarded a ship bound for England with an engineer who was her ‘cinema companion’. <u>Since all foreigners were vetted</u> <a>[C]</a> she was interviewed at Anerley school in south London and placed with a host family in Dulwich. On 14 July she took the bus to Trafalgar Square to see the march-past of the small numbers of Free French, but discovered that ‘unfortunately the Free French forces were not yet recruiting women’. She went regularly to the Free French headquarters in Carlton Gardens until a Corps féminin des Volontaires françaises was founded in November 1940; she joined the following January and went off to train in Bournemouth. <a>[1]</a></p>
 
<p>In Paris, meanwhile, Agnès Humbert, dismissed as curator at the Musée des Arts et Traditions populaires, joined forces with a number of eminent men around Jean Cassou, together with Simone Martin-Chauffier. <a>[2]</a> Since men of military age had either been dispersed by the defeat or were in POW camps, it fell to women and older men to form the first resistance groups in occupied France. Despite this key role, Humbert defined herself as a 'corridor rabbit', which is 'what they called apprentices who ran errands between the workshops of fashion houses'. Since they could not use the telephone for security reasons she took orders and instructions from one location to another. When the group met to draft a new number of their underground journal, <i>Résistance</i>, she explained that 'the men write and discuss. I type their articles. Naturally, I am the typist.' <a>[3]</a></p>
 
<p>These two stories throw up a number of interesting questions. The <i>débâcle</i> ended the conventional war fought on French soil by regular armies. One-and-a-half million young men had been captured and other soldiers were formally demobilised and sent home to take no further part in the war. In spite of an opportunity for women to step into men's shoes and continue the fight, social conventions were still stacked up against the involvement of women outside the home. French women did not get the vote until 1945 and were excluded from formal politics. The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) founded in Britain in 1917 had no sister organisation in France, even in 1940. A combination of paternalism and a cult of femininity confined women to sexually differentiated roles. Women who did become involved in resistance activity often seemed to limit themselves to certain feminine roles, highlighted their use of feminine attributes in resistance, or minimised the importance of the Resistance activity they were undertaking. That said, the defeat of 1940 was a political and social as well as a military debacle. Extraordinary circumstances created possibilities for extraordinary deeds. Vichy attempted to shore up the old order with its cult of Work, Family and Fatherland, but for many women resistance meant resistance not only to Germans but also to gender stereotypes. In May 1942, Marguerite Gannet, head of Liberation-Sud in the Isere, arrested and questioned by a German military court in Lyon as to why she had taken up arms, replied, 'Quite simply, colonel, because the men had dropped them.' <a>[4]</a></p>
 
<p>Although the Free French were overwhelmingly a body of men, some women, like Jeanne Bohec, did manage to enlist in their ranks, if only in limited numbers and for auxiliary roles. Helene Terre had begun the war in France in a conventional way as a Red Cross nurse and was not allowed anywhere near the front. Under the pressure of events, women were in time allowed to work in uniform nearer the action, transporting medicines and blood, proving their worth by driving on black ice 'when military vehicles could not get out'. Even when the military did make changes, however, public opinion was not yet ready to see women in uniform. Helene Terre recalled:</p>
 
<blockquote>the jibes to which we were subjected on the streets of Paris. We hardly dared go out in public, and when we came back from missions we quickly changed our khaki uniforms for the navy blue that the nurses wore, or else we put on civilian clothes. <a>[5]</a> </blockquote>
 
<p>Reaching Britain, Terre was put in charge of the Corps des Volontaires françaises (CVF) in December 1941. Their numbers increased to 300 in June 1942 and their pay from two-thirds of what British Army auxiliaries were paid to the equivalent. On 11 November 1942 she was invited to speak on the BBC after de Gaulle and Maurice Schumann, and took the opportunity to address 'ALL French women volunteers, that is ALL French women who want victory and liberation'. <a>[6]</a></p>

Parachuted in February 1944, she crisscrossed Brittany by bicycle, hence her nickname "the bicycle plasticizer". She formed teams of saboteurs, organized several operations and participated in the Liberation. After the war she became professor of mathematics and deputy mayor of the 18th arrondissement of Paris.
