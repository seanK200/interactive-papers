            They also follow with the greatest devotion Ss. Paul, Antony the
            first hermit, abbot Macharius, and other holy hermits. It is said
            that their emperor is most <a>Christian</a>, to whom seventy-four
            kinds and almost innumerable princes pay allegiance, except those
            kings who observe the laws of Mahomet but submit to the
            <a>emperor</a> in other things. It is known indeed that this
            emperor, in the time of Clement V [Pope, 1305 to 1314] and the year
            of our salvation 1306, sent thirty envoys to the king of the Spains
            and offered him aid against the infidels. They also presented
            themselves reverently before Pope Clement V <a>at Avignon</a> and,
            instructed by many apostolic letters, came to <a>Rome</a> to visit
            the churches of Peter and Paul. Having seen these they set forth
            joyfully to return to their own country. But as they tarried many
            days at Genoa awaiting fair weather for sailing, they were
            questioned and left (so it is said) many things in writing about
            their rites, customs and regions, which the same author has
            published.

          <b>(C)</b> This shows the historical background of Avignon Papacy,
          which started from 1309. It makes me wonder the stance of Ethiopian
          empire, as a Christian empire that doesn't belong in European
          continent, within the tension btwn the king and the church

          <b>(SU)</b> It is surprising that in the 14th century, Ethiopia gave
          so much importance to Christianity that they would send ambassadors.
