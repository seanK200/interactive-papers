          <p>
            In Ethiopia no one has yet had, or will have any suspicion of this
            for they either do not know that such a name is given to their
            Emperor or, if we tell them, they are amazed and think it strange;
            there is nothing in their language that corresponds to it nor is
            there any version of it. In Europe, however. someone may have been
            inﬂuenced by the authority of Çagâ Zà Ab (whom Damiao de Goes in the
            third part of his Chronicle of the King Don Manoel, chapter 60,
            calls Zagazabo) an ambassador sent thither by King David to the Most
            Serene Dom João 3rd of Portugal, and by that of Pedro,
            <a>another Abyssinian</a> who accompanied Father Francisco Alvares
            from Ethiopia to Portugal and thence to Italy. where he took the
            Emperor David's letters to Pope Clement 7th. These two, Çagâ Zà Ab,
            I mean, and Pedro wanted to devise versions of this name in their
            language. They did so easily among people who had no knowledge of
            it. They pretended what they liked and said that the name Prester
            John had been taken from Belul and Jan and that this meant precious
            Gian and that our people had corrupted Jan into John. All this is
            ﬁction that has no justiﬁcation in fact. Yet the Valencian who
            imagined that it must be Beldigian and that Belul Jan was not two
            words but one had still <i>less</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is certain that the Abyssinians call their Emperor Jan and
            sometimes they call him Belul also but the one is never joined with
            the other; among them it would be a solecism and a very barbarous
            expression if someone were to say 'Belul Jan' or ‘Jan Belul'. To
            each of these two names, in fact, the word 'qhoj' is usually added,
            which means the same as the word ‘my’ among us, when it is used to
            signify love or tenderness as when one says to a child, as an
            endearment, ‘my sweetheart, my prince, my king.’ This is nearly what
            the Abyssinians mean when they address their King as ‘Janqhoj’,
            ‘Ianqhoj' or ‘Belulqhoj’, though this second name is less often used
            by them than the first. To come to the root from which they were
            derived, it is this. They say that in the ancient language of
            Ethiopia ‘Jan’ means '<a>elephant</a>', and because this animal is
            so powerful and terrible compared with the rest, they applied its
            name to the King as a title of honour and grandeur. So those who
            call out at the gate of the Emperor’s enclosure for him to grant
            their suits or send someone to hear their complaints at some
            injustice that has been done to them, they name him by this name if
            they are Amarâs, shouting at the tops of their voices ‘Janqhoj,
            Janqhoj’ until the Emperor sends a servant to see what it is they
            want. I said ‘if they are Amarâs’, for if they are Moors they shout
            ‘Cidy, cidy’, if Portuguese “Senhor, senhor’, which is the same
            thing, and if Tigrês ‘Adáriê”. Those of other nations and languages
            also have their own words which are peculiar to themselves.
