            <i>Ethnology</i> <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]_1">[1]</a><br /><br />
            South-Western Ethiopia the country that lies south of the river Abay
            and west of the head-waters of the Webi-Shabelle, was occupied
            before the Galla invasion by peoples of Hamitic <a>[2]</a> stock who
            may be referred to as Sidama and represent one of the waves of
            Europoid immigrants known as Hamites are Kushites. The first
            inhabitants of north-east Africa seemed to have been negroes, who
            were gradually expelled or absorbed by the Hamitic populations that
            followed them. That there was contact between the two races is clear
            from the negroid physical characters of many of the inhabitants of
            Ethiopia; and in fact there still remain a number of the tribes of
            the Abyssinian-Sudan border which may be taken to represent the
            original negro population and are known collectively as Shangalla, a
            name derived from the Amharic word for ‘negro’. These negro peoples
            include some of the tribes of Dar Fung, and others extending as far
            south as the Konso between Lake Chamo an Lake Stephanie.<br /><br />

            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Hamites"
              >The Hamites seemed to have entered north-east Africa in 3 main
              waves which may be distinguished thus</a
            >: (A) the Proto-or A-Hamites, perhaps represented today by the Nera
            or ‘Barya’ and the Badena or Kunama of Eritrea, though both the
            ethnic and the linguistic position of these people is very
            uncertain. (B) The early or B-Hamites, represented by the peoples of
            the northern zone (Beja), central zone (Agau), and southwestern zone
            (Sidama). (C) The Later of C-Hamites, represented by the peoples of
            the eastern zone (Galla, Somali, Afar or Danakil, and Saho). During
            the later periods of the Hamitic movement there came yet another
            wave of immigration this time of Semitic peoples from south-west
            Arabia, the ancestors of the present day Semitic speaking
            Abyssinians. <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]_2">[1]</a>

          <b>(AUTH)</b> It is surprising that a document first written in 1660
          (period @ the end of oliver cromwell, etc) put so much emphasis &
          research into ethnicity. how was this information able to be
          connected? Is it perhaps not so scientific (esp. with negroid physical
          characteristics cited as evidence) or more scientific than we are led
