          <b><i>The name Prester John</i></b>
          <p>
            It is so common in Portugal and Europe for the Emperor of the
            Abyssinians to be called by this name that anyone who undertakes to
            write the history of Ethiopia and of the Abyssinian empire must
            necessarily give some explanation of it. Since, however, almost all
            the historians who have written about this country have argued about
            this matter and examined and given different explanations and
            versions of this name. I do not feel myself obliged to stop and
            repeat what can easily be found in their works. I merely remark that
            among the rest Father Nicolao Godinho of our Society, in the 5th
            chapter of his ﬁrst book on the Abyssinians, treated this question
            with greater learning and riper judgment than I bring to its
            consideration. He makes two certain and very well established
            assertions. The first is that the name Prester or Presbyter John was
            at first given to a Christian, but Nestorian, emperor, who ruled in
            the interior of Asia. His ordinary name or title was Jonanam,
            derived from the prophet Jonah (whom they so name in their language;
            Europeans have changed it to John in error). This name was common to
            the rulers of that monarchy as that of Pharaoh was to the Kings of
            Egypt. They called him Presbyter because of the cross that he always
            carried aloft before him, as among us Archbishops and Primates do.
            It is said that when he went to war he took two, one of gold and
            another of precious stones. signifying by the crosses the Christian
            religion which he professed, and by the precious material of which
            they were made by so much as precious stones and gold are greater
            than silver, copper, iron and any other metals, by so much was
            <a
              >he greater in power and glory than all the Kings of the world.</a
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            The 2nd thing that Father Nicolao Godinho asserts is quite certain.
            It is that the attribution of this name of the Asiatic emperor to
            the Emperor of Ethiopia originated in the mistake of Pero de
            Covilhao. He was sent with a companion (as we shall relate in full
            below) by King Dom Joao 2nd of illustrious memory to discover India
            and the Christian emperor popularly called Prester John, whose fame
            was then much celebrated in Europe. In Cairo, in Suaqhem and in
            Adem, which he reached and to which he returned from India, he heard
            many things told of the Emperor of the Abyssinians, among others
            that he was a Christian, master of many great kingdoms, and that he
            was in holy orders and carried a cross in his hand. He was persuaded
            that he had found him and that this was the Prester John whom his
            King had sent him to ﬁnd, and so much he wrote to him from Cairo.
            This news was welcomed in Portugal and spread throughout Europe and
            from then until now the Emperor of the Abyssinians has been held and
            taken to be and has been given the name of, Prester John. The coming
            to an end of Jonanam’s monarchy in Asia contributed to this, in that
            for many years the name of no Christian emperor in Asia was heard
            while the fame of this African one resounded daily. So the name of
            Prester John was confirmed to him and withdrawn from the Asiatic.

          (ST) The author describes the king in awe saying that he is greater
          than anyone, and expresses how important religion is to the king’s
          authority and significance with the amount of crosses he carried, and
          their material.
