         <h3> Richard Eden, <a data-ip-footnote-id="c">“The Adornment of West Africans”</a> in Decades of the New World (1555); from Paul Brians, et. Al., Reading About the World vol. 2 (Harcourt Brace Custom Books,) reprinted on the Internet Sourcebook of Modern History.</h3>

         Among other things . . . touching the manners and nature of the
          people, this may seem strange, that their princes and noblemen used
          to pounce (5) and raise their skins with pretty knots in diverse
          forms, as it were branched damask,
          <a>thinking that to be a decent ornament.</a>
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="a">And albeit they go in manner all naked</a>, yet are many of them, and
          especially their women, in manner laden with collars, bracelets,
          hoops and chains, either of gold, copper, or  <a data-ip-footnote-id="b">ivory.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          I myself have one of their bracelets of ivory, weighing two pound
          and six ounces of troy weight, which make eight and thirty ounces.
          This one of their women did wear upon her arm. It is made of one
          whole piece of the biggest part of the tooth, (6) turned and
          somewhat carved, with a hole in the midst, wherein they put their
          hands to wear it on their arm. Some have on every arm one, and as
          many on their legs, wherewith some of them are so galled that,
          although they are in manner made lame thereby, yet will they by no
          means leave them off. Some wear also on their legs
          <a>great shackles of bright copper</a>, which they think to be no
          less comely.
        </p>
        <p>
          They wear also collars, bracelets, garlands and girdles, of certain
          blue stones like beads. Likewise, some of their women wear on their
          bare arms certain foresleeves made of the plates of beaten gold. On
          their fingers also they wear rings, made of golden wires, with a
          knot or wreath, like unto that which children make in a ring of a
          rush. Among other things of gold, that our men bought of them for
          <a>exchange</a> of their wares, were certain <a>dog-chains and collars</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="d">They are very wary people in their bargaining, and will not lose one
          spark of gold of any value</a>. <a data-ip-footnote-id="e">They use weights and measures, and are
          very circumspect in occupying the same.</a>(7) They that shall have to
          do with them, must use them gently; for they will not traffic (8) or
          bring in any wares, if they <a data-ip-footnote-id="f">be evil used.</a>

          <b>(AUT)</b> The way the author describes the clothing here sounds
          like he is using particularly fall-down words because he considers the
          people inferior.

          <b>(C)</b> Ivory has been a valuable material for centuries, causing the elephants in the region to be in danger. The author does not seem to be mentioning the materials used for the women in order of value.

          <b>(SU)</b> I always thought since there was an abundance of gold generally in Africa, that they wouldn't be too wary about their gold; it is surprising to see that they are very cautious about it.

        <div class="footnotes" id="e">
