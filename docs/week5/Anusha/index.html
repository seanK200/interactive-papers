          <p><h3> Hans Mayr,“The Voyages and Acts of Dom Francisco” (1505), from E. Axelson, “South East Africa,” 1940, 231-238, quoted in G.S.P. Freeman-Grenville, The East African Coast: Selected Documents (London: Rex Collings, 1974), 105-112 and reprinted as part of the Internet Modern History Sourcebook, Paul Halsall, ed., October 1998, <http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1505mayr.html>. </h3> </p>
          <p>
            The Voyage and Acts of Dom Francisco, <a>Viceroy of India</a>,
            written in the ship Sam Rafael of Oporto, captained by Feman Suarez.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 1505, on 25 March, Tuesday, the feast of the
            Annunciation of Our Lady, Dom Francisco d'Almeida sailed with a
            fleet of twenty vessels. There were fourteen large men-of-war and
            six caravels.
          </p>
          <p>
            They rounded the <a>Cape of Good Hope</a> on 20 June and were driven
            away from it seventy leagues. On 2 July there were great storms with
            thunder, and two men from the flagship and one from the Lyomarda
            fell overboard. On 18 July they sighted land for the first time, 369
            leagues beyond the Cape of Good Hope, near the Ylhas Darradeiras,
            which are thirty leagues from <a>the island of Mozambique</a>. On 19
            July they were in sight of Mozambique, and on 21 July they were
            crossing the shallow waters of Sam Rafael, which are thirty
            <a>leagues</a>
            from Kilwa.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Tuesday, 22 July, they entered the harbour of Kilwa at noon, with
            a total of eight ships. Immediately on their arrival the
            Grand-Captain, Dom Francisco d'Almeida, sent Bona Ajuta Veneziano to
            summon the king. He excused himself from coming, but sent the
            Grand-Captain gifts instead; They were five goats, a small cow and a
            large number of coconuts and other fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next flay the Grand-Captain ordered the ships to have their
            artillery in readiness. Then the captains, each in his best clothes,
            and full armour, went in his own boat to lie off the town in the
            hope that the king would decide to come out. The <a>sheikh</a>,
            however, sent a message to say that he could not come since he had
            guests, but, if required, he would send the tribute due to the King
            of Portugal. This message was brought by a party of five Moors, who
            were immediately seized.

          <b>(SU)</b> I'm quite confused here... Did they mistake an island as
          Mozambique, or was there an island called Mozambique at the time but
