          <p>
            Our <a>factory</a> lies about three miles from the seaside, where we were
            carry’d in hamocks, which the factor Mr. Joseph Peirson, sent to
            attend our landing, with several arm’d blacks that belong’d to him
            for our guard; we were soon truss’d in a bag, toss’d upon negroes
            heads, and convey’d to our factory. Our factory, built by Capt.
            Wiburne, Sir John Wiburne’s brother, stands low near the marshes,
            which renders it a very unhealthy place to live in; the white men
            the African company send there, seldom returning to tell their tale:
            ’tis compass’d round with a mud-wall, about six foot high, and on
            the south-side is the gate; within is a large yard, a mud thatch’d
            house, where the factor lives, with the white men; also a
            store-house, a trunk for slaves, and a place where they bury their
            dead white men, call’d, very <a>improperly</a>, the hog-yard; there is also
            a good forge, and some other small houses. . . . And here I must
            observe that the rainy season begins about the middle of May, and
            ends the beginning of August, in which space it was my misfortune to
            be there, <a>which created sicknesses among my negroes aboard</a>, it being
            noted for the most malignant season by the blacks themselves, who
            while the rain lasts will hardly be prevail’d upon to stir out of
            their huts. . . . The factory prov’d beneficial to us in another
            kind; for after we had procured a parcel of slaves, and sent them
            down to the sea-side to be carry’d off, it sometimes proved bad
            weather, and so great a sea, that the canoes could not come ashore
            to fetch them, so that they returned to the factory, where they were
            secured and provided for till good weather presented, and then were
            near to embrace the opportunity, we sometimes shipping off a hundred
            of both sexes at a time. The factor, Mr. Peirson, was a brisk man,
            and had good interest with the king, and credit with the subjects,
            who knowing their tempers, which is very dastard, had good skill in
            treating them both civil and rough, as occasion requir’d; most of
            his slaves belonging to the factory, being gold coast negroes, who
            are very bold, brave, and sensible, ten of which would beat the best
            forty men the king of Whidaw had in his kingdom; besides their true
            love, respect and fidelity to their master, for whose interest or
            person they will most freely expose their own lives. . . .

            <b>(SU)</b>The choice of word here, 'factory' is surprising because looking at the description it sounds like the factory is closer to a trading post.  The word choice maypoint to the perception of getting slaves as similar to getting products from a factory; in other words, people as products.

            <b>(ST)</b> The overall style of this document indicates that this is not a humanistic worry towards the slaves, but a concern about the 'quality' of slaves.
