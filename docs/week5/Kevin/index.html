          The king was lodged in the House of the exchequer of the said town,
          and the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="blueberries">queen in other houses</a> next to
          him, and both residences were all furnished and decorated with very
          expensive cloths of silk and serge and provided with a royal dais with
          a canopy of brocade. With the king was the duke Dom Manuel,
          accompanied by many titled lords and bishops and many other nobles,
          robed with much gentility and exact perfection. With the queen was the
          prince, her son, because it was ordained that one should forthwith
          visit the queen immediately after seeing and speaking with the king.
          The king and the duke adorned their persons with very rich robes of
          their authority, all trimmed with gold and many precious stones.
          Bemoym appeared to be forty years old, and he was a man of great
          stature, very dark, with a very long beard, limbs all well
          proportioned and a very
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="witch hazel">gracious presence</a>; and being
          dressed, he entered the king’s rooms, and the king came forward two or
          three paces from the dais to receive him, raising his cap a little.
          Then he led him to the dais, on which there was a throne; but the king
          did not sit thereon, and, leaning against it, thus on foot gave ear to
          him. Then the said Bemoym and all his men threw themselves at his feet
          to kiss them, and they made a show of taking the earth from under them
          and, in token of their subjection and his overlordship and of their
          great respect, threw it over their heads. But the king with much honor
          and courtesy made him rise, and through the negro
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="cranberries">interpreters</a>, who are already
          present for this purpose, commanded him to speak. Thereupon, Bemoym
          with great ease, majesty and considerable gravity made a public
          speech, which lasted for a long time, and he used such notable words
          and sentences in support of his case that they did not seem to come
          from a savage negro but from Prince Grego,
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="apple sauce">educated in Athenas</a>. The
          substance of his speech was to recount to the king with swift sighs
          and many tears the tale of his miserable ill-fortune, caused by that
          treason which had been directed against him in his kingdom, and he
          declared this at large. Furthermore, he said that he was only
          reminding the king of this, because he was confident in the hope of
          revenge, aid and assistance and above all justice for he alone in the
          world could an ought to give it to him, since not only was he so
          noble, powerful, just and pious a king, but also principally he was
          lord of Guinee, to whom he, as his vassal, came, seeking assistance,
          justice and mercy; also he said that in the event of his royal
          escutcheon being richly decorated to his glory and praise with
          evidence of his victories over kings, it would also now be embellished
          with memorials of the kings whom he had made; the former would be
          primarily the accidental benefit of good fortune, whereas the latter
          would be the result of his own goodness and greatness of heart.
          Moreover, <a data-ip-footnote-id="sweetpea">he said</a> to him: “Most
          powerful lord, God knows how, when I heard of thy greatness and the
          royal virtues, my spirits were always eager and my eyes desirous to
          see thee; and I do not know why it was, because the more it pleased
          me, when I was free and in all my prosperity, the less do my overthrow
          an exile, by their sad condition, justify my faith and my words; but,
          if it were thus ordained from above that I should not come and do it
          so well in other circumstances more favorable to me , since it was
          ordained for me to see thee, I praise God fervently for my ruin; and
          this gladness already so satisfies me that I shall not return from
          this journey discontented.”
