            1497 The Bay of St. Helena [on the west coast of the present country
            of South Africa]. On Tuesday (November 7) we returned to the land,
            which we found to be low, with a broad bay opening into it. The
            captain-major [i.e., da Gama speaking in the third person] sent Pero
            d'Alenquer in a boat to take soundings and to search for good
            anchoring ground. The bay was found to be very clean, and to afford
            shelter against all winds except those from the N.W. It extended
            east and west, and <b><a>we named it Santa Helena</a></b
            >. <br />
            <br />

              alt="Modern image of Santa Helena"
            /><br />
            <br />
            On Wednesday (November 8) we cast anchor in this bay, and we
            remained there eight days, cleaning the ships, mending the sails,
            and taking in wood. The river Samtiagua (S. Thiago) enters the bay
            four leagues to the S.E. of the anchorage. It comes from the
            interior (sertao), is about a stone's throw across at the mouth, and
            from two to three fathoms in depth at all states of the tide. The
            inhabitants of this country are tawny-colored. Their food is
            confined to the flesh of seals, whales and gazelles, and the roots
            of herbs. They are dressed in skins, and wear sheaths over their
            virile members. They are armed with poles of olive wood to which a
            horn, browned in the fire, is attached.

                >Their numerous dogs resemble those of Portugal, and bark like
                them. The birds of the country, likewise, are the same as in
                Portuga</b
              ></a
            ><a><b>l,</b></a> and include cormorants, gulls, turtle doves,
            crested larks, and many others.

                herbage</b
              ></a
            >. On the day after we had cast anchor, that is to say on Thursday
            (November 9), we landed with the captain-major, and took
            <a><b>captive</b></a> one of the natives, who was small of stature
            like <a><b>Sancho Mexia</b></a
            >. This man had been gathering honey in the sandy waste, for in this
            country the bees deposit their honey at the foot of the mounds
            around the bushes. He was taken on board the captain-major's ship,
            and being placed at the table, he ate of all we ate. On the
            following day the captain-major had him well dressed and sent
            ashore.
