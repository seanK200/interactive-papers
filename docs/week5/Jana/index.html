         <h5> Ruy de Pina, Chronica del Rey Joao II (ca. 1488), in Africa and the
          West: A Documentary History, vol. 1 From the Slave trade to Conquest,
          1441-1905, eds. William H. Worger, Nancy L. Clark and Edward A. Alpers
          (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 17-21.
         </h5>
          <p>
            The first convert to Christianity (1488) Religion, trade, and
            politics were inextricably linked from the very beginning of contact
            between Portuguese and Africans. The Portuguese proselytized in the
            name of Christianity as they <a>sought allies against Muslim trading
            competitors</a> and political enemies and a way to secure the support of
            the papacy. The new religion had distinct attractions for some
            Africans, especially those who saw it as a political ideology that
            would gain them knew allies in their own contest for power within
            Africa. In 1488, Bemoym, King of Jalofo (at the mouth of the Senegal
            River), who was a Muslim, and the newly arrived Portuguese found
            that they had interests in common – Bemoym to regain his kingdom
            with Portuguese arms, the Portuguese to establish a base on the
            coast. Neither party expected the outcome that resulted.
          </p>
        
        </p>
        And this year one thousand four hundred and eighty-eight, while the king [John II] 
        was in Setuvel [Setubal], he made <a>a Christian of Bemoym</a>, a negro prince of the kingdom 
        of Gelof [Jalofo], which is at the entrance of the Rio de Çanaga [Senegal] in Guinee. 
        His motives and reasons for this and the manner of doing it were <a>briefly and truthfully as 
        follows</a>. During the previous year, while Gonçalo Coelho, a dependant of the king, was trafficking 
        at the mouth of the said River, the said Bemoym, who at that time with prosperity and great power 
        governed the said kingdom of Gelof, was informed through the interpreters of the royal perfection 
        and the many virtues of the king, and desiring to <a>serve</a> him, through the said Gonçalo Coelho he sent 
        him a rich present of gold one hundred slaves, all young men, with some products of his land. This man, 
        by virtue of a huge manilla of gold, which he gave the king as a letter of credence, <a>according to his 
        custom of being illiterate</a>, sent to him to ask for arms and ships; to which the king refused consent with 
        <a>just</a> reasons, based on the excommunications and the apostolic prohibitions, <a>since he [Bemoym] was not a Christian</a>. 
        Then in this year, because the said Bemoym was treacherously driven out of his kingdom, he determined to embark on 
        one of the caravels of the trade, which frequent the coast, and to come in person to seek aid, assistance 
        and justice from the king, who was in Setuvel. Bemoym arrived in Lixboa, accompanied by some negroes of 
        his own royal blood and sons of persons closely related to men of importance. When the King had been <a>informed 
        of their arrival</a>, he commanded that they should come to be entertained at Palmella, where he forthwith commanded his 
        men to make abundant provision for him and to serve him with silver and attendance and every other civility which was 
        proper to his station. Also he commanded all to be given rich and fine clothes to wear, according to the quality 
        and merit of their persons demanded. <a>And when they were in a condition to come up to court</a>, the king sent and horses 
        and mules, very well apparelled, to them all; and on the day when they were to make their entrance, the king commanded that 
        Bemoym should be received by Dom Francisco Coutinho, Count of Marialva, and with him all lords and nobleman of the court, 
        whom the king purposely ordered to be robed and adorned as well as possible.
