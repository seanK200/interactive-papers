              Hans Mayr,“The Voyages and Acts of Dom Francisco” (1505), from E. Axelson, “South East Africa,” 1940, 231-238, quoted in G.S.P. Freeman-Grenville, The East African Coast: Selected Documents (London: Rex Collings, 1974), 105-112 and reprinted as part of the Internet Modern History Sourcebook, Paul Halsall, ed., October 1998, <http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1505mayr.html>.

          </p>
          <p>People here sleep raised above the ground in hammocks made of palm leaves in which only one person can lie.</p>
<p>The Portuguese found here a large quantity of pure drinking water. Flasks of very good perfume are exported from here and a large quantity of glass of all types and all kinds of cotton piece-goods, incense, resin, gold, silver, and pearls. The Grand-Captain ordered the loot to be deposited under seal in a house.</p>
<p>The fortress of Kilwa was built out of the best house there was. All the other houses around it were pulled down. It was fortified and guns were set in place with everything else a fort needs. Pero Ferreira was left in command of it with eighty men.</p>
<p>The country is not very hot. The men are armed with bows and large arrows, strong shields of palm leaves bound with cotton, and pikes better than those of Guinea. Few swords were seen. They have four catapults for hurling stones but do not yet know the use of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The sea laps the entrance of the fortress at high water near where the ships enter.</p>
<p>When the king fled from Kilwa, the Grand Captain appointed another, a local Moor beloved by all, whom they took in procession on horseback through the town.</p>
<p>Lime is prepared here in this manner: large logs of wood are piled in a circle and inside them coral limestone is placed; then the wood is burnt. The process after that is the same as in Portugal.</p>
<p>Cotton is found in abundance. It is of good quality and is planted and grows well in the island. The sheep have wool no better than goats. The slaves wear a cotton cloth round the waist and down to the knees; the rest of the body is naked. The white Arabs and slave owners wear two pieces of cotton cloth, one round the waist down to the feet and the other thrown over the shoulders and reaching down as far as where the first cloth is tied.</p>
<p>They have copper coins like our ceptis, four being equal to one real; Portuguese coins have the same value there as at home. There are no gold coins but the weight of their mitical is equal to 460 reis in Portugal.</p>
<p>The winter season in Kilwa is from April to September. It is not cold and for this reason the people wear scanty clothes.</p>
<p>The Grand-Captain twice went from one side of the town to the other. Once he saw twenty-five gazelle which had been let loose on the island. There are also many wild cats in the bush.</p>
<p>There are many vaulted mosques, one of which is like that of Cordova. All the upper-class Moors carry a <a>rosary</a>.</p>
