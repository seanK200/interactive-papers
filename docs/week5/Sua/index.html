            In this kingdom,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="faith">faith is as fragile as glass</a>
            because of the bad examples of the men who come to teach here,
            because the lusts of the world and the lure of wealth have turned
            them away from the truth. Just as the Jews crucified the Son of God
            because of covetousness, my brother, so today He is again crucified.

              1515)</b
            >
            <br /><br />Sir, Your Highness should know how our Kingdom is being
            lost in so many ways that it is convenient to provide for the
            necessary remedy since this is
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="caused">caused by the excessive freedom </a
            >given by your factors and officials to
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="men"
              >the men and merchants who are allowed to come</a
            >
            to this Kingdom to set up shops with goods and many things which
            have been prohibited by us, and which they spread throughout our
            Kingdoms and Domains in such an abundance that many of our vassals,
            whom we had in obedience, do not comply because they have the things
            in greater abundance than we ourselves; and it was with these things
            that we had them content and subjected under our vassalage and
            jurisdiction, so it is doing a great harm not only to the service of
            God, but to the security and peace of our Kingdoms and State as
            well. And we cannot reckon how great the damage is since the
            mentioned merchants are taking every day our natives, some of the
            land and sons of our noblemen and vassals and our relatives, because
            the thieves and men of bad conscience grab them wishing to have the
            things and wares of this Kingdom which they are ambitious of; they
            grab them and get them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the
            corruption and licentiousness that our country is being completely
            depopulated, and Your Highness should not agree with this or accept
            it as in your service. And<a data-ip-footnote-id="avoid">
              to avoid it we need from those [your] Kingdoms no more than some
              priests </a
            >and a few people to teach in schools, and no other goods except
            wine and flour for the holy sacrament. That is why we beg of Your
            Highness to help and assist us in this matter, commanding your
            factors that they should not send here either merchants or wares,
            because it is our will that in these Kingdoms there should not be
            any trade in slaves or outlets for them. Concerning what is referred
            [to] above, again we beg of Your Highness to agree with it, since
            otherwise we cannot remedy such an obvious damage. Pray Our Lord in
            His mercy to have Your Highness under His guard and let you do
            forever the things of His service. I kiss your hands many times.
