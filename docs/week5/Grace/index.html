            Hans Mayr,“The Voyages and Acts of Dom Francisco” (1505), from E. Axelson, “South East Africa,” 1940, 231-238, quoted in G.S.P. Freeman-Grenville, The East African Coast: Selected Documents (London: Rex Collings, 1974), 105-112 and reprinted as part of the Internet Modern History Sourcebook, Paul Halsall, ed., October 1998.

          <p>
            At dawn on Thursday, 24 July, the vigil of the feast of St. James the Apostle, all went in their boats to the shore. The first to land was the Grand-Captain, and he was followed by the others. They went straight to the royal palace, <a>and on the way only those Moors who did not fight were granted their lives</a>. At the <a>palace</a> there was a Moor leaning out of the window with a Portuguese flag in his hand, shouting: ‘Portugal! Portugal!’ This flag had been left behind by the admiral [Vasco da Gama] when he had arranged for Kilwa to pay a tribute of 1,500 ounces of gold a year. The Moor was asked to open the door, and, when he did not do so, the door was broken down with axes. They found neither the Moor nor anyone else in the Palace, which was deserted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Kilwa there are many strong houses several storeys high. They are built of stone and mortar and plastered with various designs. As soon as the town had been taken without opposition, the Vicar-General and some of the Franciscan fathers came ashore carrying two crosses in procession and singing the Te Deum. They went to the palace, and there the cross was put down and the Grand-Captain prayed. Then everyone started to plunder the town of all its merchandise and provisions.

          (Q) So they went in by force. They don’t seem to care that much whether the inhabitants will like them or not for doing so. Does this mean that they regarded kilwa solely as a money-making enterprise and not a place where they needed to appear nice enough to rule? Was it not a place where they wanted to settle long-term? <br />(A) According to the African History book, that had had been how they unfortunately ruled Africa, if we can call it "ruling". They cared about material gains rather than making the African populace educated and enlightened like Europeans.  This was the purported reason of colonialism. Civilizing the "negro savages", in the words of colonialists.

            (C) What did African palaces of the time look like? Were they built to withstand war like Medieval castles?
