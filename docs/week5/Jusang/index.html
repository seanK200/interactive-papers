            His godfathers were the king, the queen, the prince, the duke, a
            commissary of the pope who was at the court, and the bishop of
            Tanger who at the time was the licentiate Caçadilha. Dom Justo,
            bishop of <a>Cepta</a>, who in pontifical performed the office,
            baptized them, and Bemoym received the name Dom Joham for love of
            the king. Moreover, on the seventh day of November, the king dubbed
            him a knight; and twenty-four others of his men were made Christians
            in the counting-house of the said town. The king gave him a
            coat-of-arms consisting of a golden cross on a red field surrounded
            by the escutcheon of the arms of Portugal. On this same day, in a
            solemn act and speaking as a great lord be rendered obedience and
            paid homage to the king. Also he sent another submission, written in
            Latin, to the pope, wherein he gave an account of his case and of
            his conversion to the faith in words of deep devotion and high
            praise to the king. The king determined to give him help and
            assistance, and gave him twenty armed caravels. The captain of the
            caravels was Pero Vaaz da Cunha, who
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]"
              >carried orders to build at the entrance of the Rio da Çanaga a
              fortress, which was not to be given to the said Bemoym, but was
              always to belong to the king</a
            >. For this purpose a great quantity of stones and planed timber was
            then prepared, and also priests were assembled and a great number of
            articles for churches and for the business of conversion; and Master
            Alvaro, preacher to the king, of the order of Sam Domingos, was
            selected to be the principal person.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]"
              >One of the very chief reasons which inspired the king to prepare
              this fleet, and especially to undertake the building of a fortress
              at the entrance of this river, was his conviction that the said
              river, penetrating far into the interior, flowed to the city of
              Tambucutu [Timbuktu] and by Mombare, where are the richest trades
              and markets of gold in the world, from which all Berberia from
              east and west up to Jherusalem is supplied and provided.</a
            >
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]"
              >For he believed that the said fortress in order to free and
              safeguard the trade would provide great security in such a place
              for his men and the merchandise.</a
            >
            This region up to the river and a little beyond was discovered in
            the time and by the command of the Infante Dom Anrique, the inventor
            and discoverer of this enterprise and the conquest of Guinee; and in
            his letters and records it appears that he called this river the
            <a>Nillo</a>, not that which enters the Mar do Levante at
            Alexandria, but another branch of it which the cosmographers say
            runs out to this ocean sea. But the real truth of this up to now –
            which is the time of our lord King Dom Manuel the First – has yet to
            be learned. Nevertheless, all these works, expenses and plans of
            Bemoym were <a>changed</a> to deeds of evil; because, after the said
            Pero Vaaz had put to land and entered into the said river, by
            readily believing suspicions of disloyalty and treason against
            Bemoym, or more truthfully because he wanted to return to the
            kingdom, he slew the said Bemoym with a sword, and then returned to
            this kingdom; whereat the king, being in Tavilla, grew very sad; and
            he overlooked this crime by Pero Vaaz, seeing that he did not visit
            <a>heavy punishment</a> upon him or many others who served it for
            the same reason; yet the king strongly disapproved of their killing
            him, since, being accomplices in such an error, they ought to have
            been treated as they treated him, because they had him freely in
            their power without offence or peril.
