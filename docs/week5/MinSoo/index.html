      <a data-ip-footnote-id="compliment"> As soon as the king understood of our landing, he sent two of his cappasheirs, or noblemen, to compliment us </a> at our factory, where we design’d to continue, that night, and pay our devoirs to his majesty next day, which we signify’d to them, and they, by a foot-express, to their monarch; whereupon he sent two more of his grandees to invite us there that night, saying he waited for us, and that all former captains used to attend him the first night: whereupon being unwilling to infringe the custom, or give his majesty any offence, we took our hamocks, and Mr. Peirson, myself, Capt. Clay, our surgeons, pursers, and about 12 men, arm’d for our guard, were carry’d to the king’s town, which contains about 50 houses. . . .
  </p>
  <p>
      <a data-ip-footnote-id="returned">We returned</a> him thanks by his interpreter, and assur’d him how great affection our masters, the royal African company of England, bore to him, for his civility and fair and just dealings with their captains; and that notwithstanding there were many other places, more plenty of negro slaves that begg’d their custom, yet they had rejected all the advantageous offers made them out of their good will to him, and therefore had sent us to trade with him, to supply his country with necessaries, and that we hop'd he would endeavour to continue their favour by his kind usage and fair dealing with us in our trade, that we may have our slaves with all expedition, which was the making of our voyage; that he would oblige his cappasheirs to do us justice, and not impose upon us in their prices; all which we should faithfully relate to our masters, the royal African company, when we came to England. He answer’d that the <a>African company</a> was a very good brave man; that he lov’d him; that we should be fairly dealt with, and not impos’d upon; But he did not prove as good as his word; nor indeed (tho’ his cappasheirs shew him so much respect) dare he do any thing but what they please . . . so after having examin’d us about our cargoe, what sort of goods we had, and what quantity of slaves we wanted, etc., we took our leaves and return’d to the factory, having promised to come in the morning to make our palavera, or agreement, with him about prices, how much of each of our goods for a slave.
