          <p>
            According to our promise we attended his majesty with samples of our
            goods, and made our agreement about the prices, tho’ not without
            much difficulty; he and his cappasheirs exacted very high, but at
            length we concluded as per the latter end; then we had warehouses, a
            kitchen, and lodgings assign’d us but none of our rooms had doors
            till we made them, and put on locks and keys; next day we paid our
            customs to the king and cappasheirs, as will appear hereafter; then
            the bell was order’d to go about to give notice to all people to
            bring their slaves to the trunk to sell us: this bell is a hollow
            piece of iron in shape of a sugar loaf, the cavity of which could
            contain about 50 lb. of cowries: This a man carry’d about and beat
            with a stick, which made a small dead sound. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Capt. Clay and I had agreed to go to the trunk to buy the slaves by
            turns, each his day, that we might have no distraction or
            disagreement in our trade, as often happens when there are here more
            ships than one, and the commanders can’t set their horses together,
            and go hand in hand in their traffick, whereby they have a check
            upon the blacks, whereas their disagreements create animosities,
            underminings, and out-bidding each other, whereby they enhance the
            prices to their general loss and detriment, the blacks well knowing
            how to make the best use of such opportunities, and as we found make
            it their business, and endeavour to create and foment
            misunderstandings and jealousies between commanders, it turning to
            their great account in the disposal of their slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we were at the trunk, the king’s slaves, if he had any, were
            the first offer’d to sale, which the cappasheirs would be very
            urgent with us to buy, and would in a manner force us to it ere they
            would shew us any other, saying they were the Reys Cosa, and we must
            not refuse them, tho’ as I observ’d they were generally the worst
            slaves in the trunk, and we paid more for them than any others,
            which we could not remedy, it being one of his majesty’s
            prerogatives: then the cappasheirs each brought out his slaves
            according to his degree and quality, the greatest first, etc. and
            our surgeon examin’d them well in all kinds, to see that they were
            sound wind and limb, making them jump, stretch out their arms
            swiftly, looking in their mouths to judge of their age; for the
            cappasheirs are so cunning, that they shave them all close before we
            see them, so that let them be never so old we can see no grey hairs
            in their heads or beards; and then having liquor’d them well and
            sleek with palm oil, ’tis no easy matter to know an old one from a
            middle-age one, , but by the teeths decay; but our greatest care of
            all is to buy none that are pox d, lest they should infect the rest
            aboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we had selected from the rest such as we liked, we agreed in
            what goods to pay for them, the prices being already stated before
            the king, how much of each sort of merchandize we were to give for a
            man, woman, and child, which gave us much ease, and saved abundance
            of disputes and wranglings , and gave the owner a note, signifying
            our agreement of the sorts of goods; upon delivery of which the next
            day he receiv’d them; then we mark’d the slaves we had bought in the
            breast, or shoulder, with a hot iron, having the letter of the
            ship’s name on it, the place being before anointed with a little
            palm oil, which <a>caus’d but little pain</a>, the mark being
            usually well in four or five days, appearing very plain and white
            after.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we had purchas’d to the number of 5 ° or 6 ° we would send them
            aboard, there being a cappasheir, intitled the captain of the
            slaves, whose care it was to secure them to the water-side, and see
            them all off; and if in carrying to the marine any were lost, he was
            bound to make them good, to us, the captain of the trunk being
            oblig’d to do the like, if any ran away while under hiscare, for
            after we buy them we give him charge of them till the captain of the
            slaves comes to carry them away: These are two officers appointed by
            the king for this purpose, to each of which every ship pays the
            value of a slave in what goods they like best for their trouble,
            when they have done trading; and indeed they discharg’d their duty
            to us very faithfully, we not having lost one slave thro’ their
            neglect in 1300 we bought here.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is likewise a captain of the sand, who is appointed to take
            care of the merchandize we have come ashore to trade with, that the
            negroes do not plunder them, we being often forced to leave goods a
            whole night on the sea shore, for want of porters to bring them up;
            but notwithstanding his care and authority, we often came by the
            loss, and could have no redress.
          </p>
          <p>
            When our slaves were come to the seaside, our canoes were ready to
            carry them off to the longboat, if the sea permitted, and she
            convey’d them aboard ship, where the men were all put in irons, two
            and two shackled together, to prevent their mutiny, or swimming
            ashore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The negroes are so wilful and loth to leave their own country, that
            they have often leap’d out of the canoes, boat and ship, into the
            sea, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being
            taken up and saved by our boats, which pursued them; they having a
            more dreadful apprehension of Barbadoes than we can have of hell,
            tho’ in reality they live much better there than in their own
            country; but home is home, etc.: we have likewise seen divers of
            them eaten by the sharks, of which a prodigious number kept about
            the ships in this place, and I have been told will follow her hence
            to Barbadoes, for the dead negroes that are thrown over-board in the
            passage. I am certain in our voyage there we did not want the sight
            of some every day, but that they were the same I can’t affirm.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had about 12 negroes did wilfully drown themselves, and others
            starv’d themselves to death; for ’tis their belief that when they
            die they return home to their own country and friends again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been inform’d that some commanders have cut off the legs and
            arms of the most wilful, to terrify the rest, for they believe if
            they lose a member, they cannot return home again: I was advis’d by
            some of my officers to do the same, but I could not be [persuaded]
            to entertain the least thought of it, much less put in practice such
            barbarity and cruelty to poor creatures, who, excepting their want
            of christianity and true religion (their misfortune more than fault)
            are as much the works of God’s hands, and <a>no doubt as dear to him</a> as
            ourselves; nor can I imagine why they should be despis’d for their
            colour, being what they cannot help, and the effect of the climate
            it has pleas’d God to appoint them. I can’t think there is any
            [intrinsic] value in one colour more than another, nor that white is
            better than black, only we think so because we are so, and <a>are prone
            to judge</a> favourably in our own tase, as well as the blacks, who in
            odium of the colour, say, the devil is white, and so paint him. . .
