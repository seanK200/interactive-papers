            <br /><br />Sir, Your Highness should know how our Kingdom is being
            lost in so many ways that it is convenient to provide for the
            necessary remedy since this is
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="caused">caused by the excessive freedom </a
            >given by your factors and officials to
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="men"

            >
            to this Kingdom to set up shops with goods and many things which
            have been prohibited by us, and which they spread throughout our
            Kingdoms and Domains in such an abundance that many of our vassals,
            whom we had in obedience, do not comply because they have the things
            in greater abundance than we ourselves; and it was with these things
            that we had them content and subjected under our vassalage and
            jurisdiction, so it is doing a great harm not only to the service of
            God, but to the security and peace of our Kingdoms and State as
            well. And we cannot reckon how great the damage is since the
            mentioned merchants are taking every day our natives, some of the
            land and sons of our noblemen and vassals and our relatives, because
            the thieves and men of bad conscience grab them wishing to have the
            things and wares of this Kingdom which they are ambitious of; they
            grab them and get them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the
            corruption and licentiousness that our country is being completely
            depopulated, and Your Highness should not agree with this or accept
            it as in your service. And<a data-ip-footnote-id="avoid">
              to avoid it we need from those [your] Kingdoms no more than some
              priests </a
            >and a few people to teach in schools, and no other goods except
            wine and flour for the holy sacrament. That is why we beg of Your
            Highness to help and assist us in this matter, commanding your
            factors that they should not send here either merchants or wares,
            because it is our will that in these Kingdoms there should not be
            any trade in slaves or outlets for them. Concerning what is referred
            [to] above, again we beg of Your Highness to agree with it, since
            otherwise we cannot remedy such an obvious damage. Pray Our Lord in
            His mercy to have Your Highness under His guard and let you do
            forever the things of His service. I kiss your hands many times.

            Very high and very powerful prince King of Portugal, our brother,
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir, your highness has been so good as to promise us that anything
            we need we should ask for in our letters, and that everything will
            be provided. And so that there may be peace and health of our
            kingdoms, by God’s will, in our lifetime. And as there are among us
            old folks and people who have lived for many days, many and
            different diseases happen so often that we are pushed to the
            ultimate extremes. And the same happens to our children, relatives,
            and people, because this country lacks physicians and surgeons who
            might know the proper cures for such diseases, as well as pharmacies
            and drugs to make them better. And for this reason many of those who
            had been already confirmed and instructed in the things of the holy
            faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ perish and die. And the rest of the
            people for the most part cure themselves with herbs and sticks and
            other ancient methods, so that they live putting all their faith in
            these herbs and ceremonies, and die believing that they are saved;
            and this serves God poorly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a
              >And to avoid such a great error, I think, and inconvenience,
              since it is from God and from your highness that all the good and
              the drugs and medicines have come to us for our salvation, we ask
              your merciful highness to send us two physicians and two
              pharmacists and one surgeon, so that they may come with their
              pharmacies and necessary things to be in our kingdoms, for we have
              extreme need of each and every one of them.</a
            >
            We will be very good and merciful to them, since sent by your
            highness, their work and coming should be for good. We ask your
            highness as a great favor to do this for us, because besides being
            good in itself it is in the service of God as we have said above.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience
            which is of little service to God, and this
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="is that"
              >is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the
              wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your
              people</a
            >, and
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="in order to"
              >in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our
              people</a
            >, freed and exempt men; and very often it happens that they kidnap
            even noblemen and the sons of noblemen, and our relatives, and take
            them to be sold to the white men who are in our Kingdoms and take
            them hidden or by night, so that they are not recognized.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as soon as they are taken by the white men they are immediately
            ironed and branded with fire, and when they are carried to be
            embarked [on ships]. If they are caught by our guards’ men the
            whites allege that they have bought them but they cannot say from
            whom, so that it is our duty to do justice and to restore to the
            freemen their freedom, but it cannot be done if your subjects feel
            offended, as they claim to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            And to avoid such a great evil
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="we passed">we passed a law</a> so that
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="any white"
              >any white man living in our Kingdoms and wanting to purchase
              goods in any way should first inform three of our noblemen and
              officials of our court</a
            >
            whom we rely upon in this matter … who should investigate if the
            mentioned goods are captives or free men, and if cleared by them
            there will be no further doubt nor embargo for them to be taken and
            embarked.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="But if the"
              >But if the white men do not comply with it they will lose their
              aforementioned goods.</a
            >
            And if we do them this favour and concession it is for the part Your
            Highness has in it, since we know that it is in your service too
            that these goods are taken from our Kingdom, otherwise we should not
            consent to this …

              >(Extracts of letter of King Afonso to the King of Portugal, Joao
              III, October 18, 1526. By hand of Dom Joao Teixeria)</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Six of our relatives go in the company of Dom Manuel, our brother
            whom we now send to Rome to offer our obedience (as we have written
            to Your Highness through him). Because Your Highness knows their
            rank, we write to you so that in this way they may be shown favour
            and orders be given for their maintenance. [They are] Dom Manuel our
            grandson, son of our daughter, a nobleman with lands and vassals and
            of the twelve of our Court; and Dom Pedro de Castro who is our
            nephew on both sides [of the family], son of a cousin and a cousin
            of a sister, a person who has already been to that kingdom with the
            bishop, Dom Henrique, our son, who is in holy glory. These two men
            go in order to remain in the kingdom, where they will learn to read
            and write and [to understand] things [necessary] for God’s service.
            Dom Mateus and Dom Henrique are also our nephews. These two are
            ordered to accompany our said brother and ambassador on the journey
            to Rome, so that they can bear witness to the good and holy things
            which they will see there; and they will learn about them and speak
            of them to those who have not seen them. Dom Gonçalo and Dom
            Francisco de Meneses, also our nephews and intimates, who from their
            extreme youth have been brought up in the church and in our chapel,
            go to receive minor orders, and they will learn and in due time be
            able to teach others.<br/><br />
            We request Your Highness’s favour to order them to be made welcome,
            provided for and treated as our relatives and members of our
            lineage, which they are. And we remind you of this and request your
            favour with them, so that they can fulfill the orders with which we
            have sent them from this kingdom. For during the lifetime of the
            king, your father (whom God has in his glory), and at his orders, we
            sent from this kingdom to Portugal, through a certain António Viera,
            twenty or more boys, grandsons, nephews and relatives of ours, who
            were among the most intelligent, to learn about the service of God,
            for such was the said king’s intention and desire. Anónio Viera left
            some of the said boys in the Pangu a Lungu, our enemy, and these
            were later only able to recover with much difficulty. Others whom he
            left in the island of Sao Tomé came back to us. He took only ten
            boys to that kingdom [of Portugal], and to this day we do not know
            whether they are alive or dead, or what has become of them or what
            explanation to give to their parents. We presume that, as it was not
            known that they were our relatives, and no one reminded Your
            Highness of them, they perished and died in destitution. However, we
            are hopeful that for these youths there will be a different remedy,
            and favour will be shown [to them] by the grace of Your Highness,
            whose life and royal estate the Lord God has always in his keeping
            and whom he preserves for His holy service. <b>(Letter to Joao III,

They both answer what slave trade was in Africa. Joao III answers how people harvested sugarcane during this time and the roles of male and female slave. Before Joao III’s letter, Affonso I appealed to Joao III to stop hijacking people for slaves as his country was depopulated.<sup>1</sup> Portugal needed slaves for sugar plantation.<sup>2</sup> Affonso I couldn’t stop selling slaves but had to prevent kidnapping for his profit.<sup>3</sup><br><br><sup>1</sup> First Name Last name, <i>Title of the Book</i> (City: Publisher, Date), page number.<br><br><sup>2</sup> First Name Last name, <i>Title of the Book</i> (City: Publisher, Date), page number.<br><br><sup>3</sup> First Name Last name, <i>Title of the Book</i> (City: Publisher, Date), page number.<br><br><b>Previous Answers</b><br><br> The excerpts from King Affonso I’s letter to Manuel I and King Joao III of Portugal wished to find answers to why Portuguese slave trade in the Congo is still going on when it is making slave merchants corrupt and depopulating the Congo. Affonso I, inquired the end of the slave trade by showing examples of how the slave trade has led slave merchants to steal innocent, noble and free humans and sell them at night or secretly to the slave masters who brand them as their property. This text, therefore, seeks answers as to why the Portuguese are using Portugueses merchandises to lure slave merchants to forsake their values and sell Congolese into slavery, even Congolese nobles were also captured and sold to the white who branded them as their slaves. Surprisingly, King Jao III replied to the letter also seeking why he should end the slave trade in the Congo when the Portuguese in the Congo claim that the population of the Congo is high that they do not see any evidence of depopulation. This, therefore, shows a clash of ideas and self-interest between King Affonso I of Congo and King Jao III of Portuguese, while King Affonso seeks answers to end the slave trade in the Congo because it is affecting his people, King Jao III saw no need to end the slave trade in the Congo because the Portuguese were benefiting from the slave trade in Congo.

            <div class="footnotes" id="11"> Affonso I gives a summary of what slave trade was like. The free African men of Congo were constantly kidnapped and sold to the white people for plantation. Joao III mentioned that his people told him that Congo was not depopulated. He then described the life of slaves. Female slaves helped out with weeding plants. They also helped with household chores and production of grain. Both gender of the slaves were burdened with labor. However, they aren’t fed enough to withstand the workload nor given adequate residential environment [4]. These conditions lead to short life expectancy and breakouts of the slaves [5]. Joao III needed continuous stream of slaves to maintain the sugar plantation. <br><br><b>Previous Answers</b><br><br> Letter exchanges from a ruler of the Kongo Empire, Affonso I, to the Portuguese kings Mannuel I and Joao III, illustrates how the Portuguese motherland’s reckless slave trade depopulated its subjugated colony, the Kongo Empire. Although Affonso I emotionally appeals to the Portuguese kings challenging Portuguese’s hypocritical Christian faith neglecting the humanism, the Portuguese king response illustrates how the empire only concerns about its economic revitalization based on mercantilism. The Portuguese empire revitalized its national wealth by subjugating the Kongo empire and its citizens as slaves through the slave trade. This resulted in the depopulation of the Kongo Empire.

            <div class="footnotes" id="12"> The writers composed the text as letters between two people. This method is effective to depict both sides’ opinion. Affonso I wrote his letter as pitifully as possible in order to earn sympathy from Joao III. He was very pleading to king Joao III and used formal language in order to ask him to stop kidnapping his people as slaves. . In contrast, Joao III’s text is very descriptive and informative as it describes the sugar cane plantations and the roles of slaves. He also used metaphors such as depicting the slaves as cows. He concluded his text by asking a question of why he should stop bringing slaves when they give them an astronomical amount of money, implying that he won’t stop. <br><br><b> Previous Answers</b><br><br> Affonso’s letters to Mauel I and King Joao III are written in both a persuasive/argumentative style. Affonso’s letter is very much biased in the sense that it contains his opinion on the slave trade. For example, at the very start of his letter Affonso gives his opinion of the religious official saying, “the bad example of the men who come to teach here, because the lusts of the world and the lure of wealth have turned them away from the truth.” (pg 75, ⁋1). Affonso then clearly states the purpose of his letter, which is to stop the slave trade when he writes to Joao III, “We beg your Highness to help and assist us in this matter… because it is our will that in these Kingdoms there should not be any trade if slaves nor outlet for them.” (75, ⁋2). Affonso uses very strong language to make his point that the slave trade is something bad, describing the process as, seizing, kidnapping, and branding, “children if this country, sons of our nobels and vassals, even people of our own family.” (70, ⁋3) Another tool that Affonso uses to persuade the kind is to write appealing to religion. He describes the motives of the slave trade using many ideas which are disapproved by Christianity including, “greed”, “lust”, “forget their belief in God” (70, ⁋4/5) Since the first letter in fact he makes it clear that this type of trade is “little service to God” (70, ⁋2) This text is written from the perspective of a member of the Kongo which was where the Portuguese were obtaining their slaves. We are able to see from this text that Affonso has a very different idea of the slave trade compared to King Joao III, since the King of Portugal’s response is simply that the people he has in the Kongo do not tell him that there is depopulation (so he basically calls him a liar). As we see in the primary source 13.5 it is clear that the Blacks were targeted for slavery compared to white and mixed. This could contribute to the different perspectives since maybe the King’s men were not seeing the full effect of the slave trade on the Black population, or simply they turned the other way to make profit.

            <div class="footnotes" id="13"> Kongo began trading with the Portuguese in the 1480s, which initially was beneficial for the nation. <sup>1</sup> Yet the Portuguese began to kidnap and enslave free-born Kongo men in the 16th century. The illegal slavery was due to the private trading’s corruption and demand of the Portuguese for more labor. <sup>2</sup> Thus, Affonso I sent a letter pleading with Joao III to stop the Portuguese merchants from enslaving free Kongo man.<br><br><sup>1</sup> Paul Cunningham, <i> Colonialism in the Congo: Conquest, Conflict, and Commerce </i> (Providence: Choices Program, Watson Institue for International Studies, 2007), 4. </br> <br><br><br><sup>2</sup> Bruce Fish, Dan Harmon, and Becky Durost Fish, <i> Congo </i> (Philadelphia: Chelsea House, 2001), 48 - 51 </br><br><br><br><br> Previous Answer </br><br><br>The context of these letters from Affonso I to Manuel I and King Joao III is the beginnings of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade in the mid-sixteenth centuries. Although the Africans already had an existing practice of slave trade, it was in 1525 that slaves were first sent directly from Africa to European colonies in the Americas. Most of the letters in the excerpts are written in 1526, and depicts the rather immediate negative reaction of Affonso I towards the overseas slave trade. It makes sense that the letters were sent to Manuel I and King Joao III, both Portuguese kings of their respective time periods. According to the textbook, “the world’s leading slave traders were also the world’s most important maritime powers during 1501-1900,” and this includes the Spanish and Portuguese. At the time, these imperialist powers were able to use their maritime strength to dominate trade routes and set up colonies. Affonso I’s predecessor welcomed Portuguese missionaries and merchants to his kingdom, and he along with other Kongo leaders were converted to Christianity, leading to religious divides between the converted and unconverted. This is perhaps what Affonso I, a Christian himself, was referring to when he describes how “faith is as fragile as glass” in his 1515 letter to Manuel I. The religious divides may also explain the apparent tension between how Affonso I writes, “we need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise… it is our wish that this kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves” and the contradicting practices of African slave traders themselves. The European’s large demand for slaves to work in the fields to produce profitable agricultural goods began to deplete the Kongo’s labor force and population. Affonso I writes in his July 6, 1526 letter: “this corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated.” The excerpts of the letters coupled with the gender imbalance as described in the textbook corroborate how the slave trade was further exacerbated and the population further declined.
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="14"> King Joao’s response was mostly consisted of doubtful answers. For instance, Joao’s assertion that “Kongo preserved high population as if no slave left” was questionable, as Kongo was experiencing decreasing population. <sup>3</sup> Also, Joao insisted that “slaves were better treated than servants”. Yet, slaves were preferred to indentured servants because they were a cheaper alternative. Slaves were never assured of an income, while servants were regularly paid. <sup>4</sup><br><br><sup>3</sup> Bruce Fish, Dan Harmon, and Becky Durost Fish, <i> Congo </i>, 48. <br></br><br><br><sup>4</sup> Luis Angeles, <i> On the Causes of the African Slave Trade </i>, 1-2. <br></br><br><br> Previous Answer </br><br>The missing from “Correspondence between Affonso” page 1 is not properly explains how Affonso think about Manuel I. There is not enough description upon their relationship between Congo and Portugal. In line 9 says “which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men…” It should have mentioned more what and how Congo had obeyed to Portugal.
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="15">  It was surprising that Kongo vassals condoned the illegal slavery to gain private benefits from the Portuguese merchants. Such corruption happened as local vassals gained wealth through slave trading and no longer relied on Affonso to supply the imports. <sup>5</sup>Affonso’s authority gradually weakened as he wasn’t able to protect his citizens from slavery. <br><br><sup>5</sup> Bruce Fish, Dan Harmon, and Becky Durost Fist, <i> Congo </i>, 48. <br></br><br><br> Previous Answer </br><br>The correspondence between Affonso I and Joao III presents a scenario that is not dissimilar to modern day issues regarding world trade. Though modern trade routes do not explicitly conduct slave trades, the issues experienced by Affonso I illustrate the plight of many developing nations entering a world trade system. Affonso emphasizes that “we need in [his] kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise unless it is wine and flour for Mass,” illustrating that his nation does not need Portugal’s luxurious goods (1). Despite the lack of need, it is the desire for these luxury items that drives Affonso’s kingdom to essentially depopulate themselves through the trading of their own families and neighbors in order to acquire these items. What is interesting is that even in the earliest developments of world trade systems, there was a belief that trade was a zero-sum game or essentially that one nation must lose for another nation to gain. In this case, the people of Kongo were losing their livelihood and freedom for few private gains, whereas the Portuguese were gaining significant wealth through the slave trade. Though some may argue the Kongo gained material possessions, according to Affonso the nation as a whole was in decline do the rampant corruption and depravity being conducted throughout his kingdom. In conclusion, Affonso’s correspondence with Joao III depicts the beginning of the formation of the Global North and the Global South, where essentially there becomes an imbalance of net gains in world trade systems.

            <div class="footnotes" id="30"> Affonso faced two problems. First, the population of his kingdom was dropping, and his authority was being undermined as village and provincial fiefs became wealthy through the slave trade. They no longer depended on Affonso’s goodwill for their power. Second, although he did not seem to understand this at first, the Portuguese government preferred to have the slave trade continue so that it could benefit from the riches of South America. The government was less concerned about keeping agreements to provide Affonso with medicine and technology. In 1526 Affonso wrote a letter to the King Joao III of Portugal.(48)

            <div class="footnotes" id="31">Slaves were mostly a product of war, as evidenced by the fact that the same Kikongo word meant both slave and war captive. (32)
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="32"> The new King changed his name to Affonso I. He ordered all of his chiefs and nobles to become Christians. He chose a European name for his capital city: Sao Salvador. He ordered burning of all religious objects using Kongo ceremonies. So many churches were built in Sao Salvador. He learned to read and write Portuguese himself and continued to send his sons to Portugal for schooling. (19) <br></br>The Portuguese merchants brought books, printers, and other beneficial imports to Africa. Portuguese needed slaves to work on their large plantations in Brazil. Since the Kongo Kingdom was very powerful, the Portuguese needed his permission to transport slaves from the interior of the continent. The Kongo profited from his control of the slave trade. As long as he cooperated with the Portuguese, the Kongo king would stay in power. (20) <br></br>He enjoyed a close relationship with King Manuel of Portugal. King Manuel referred to Affonso as his royal "brother". The two wrote letters to each other regularly and exchanged gifts to show their mutual friendship and respect.(20)
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="33"> Incidentally, the low cost of slave capturing within Africa also offers an explanation for why indentured servitude never developed as an alternative to slavery. For an African peasant to go into voluntary servitude he would need to be assured of a lifelong income at least as high as the one he earns in Africa. Europeans could have offered this, though the magnitude of the migration would arguably have been smaller than the 12.5 million people of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. The option never materialized, however, because a cheaper alternative was available. Low costs of slave capturing meant that Europeans could pay African slave traders a price that assured them a proﬁt and yet remained more economical than buying indentured servants. (27)
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="34"> In a state that consistently exported large numbers of slaves throughout the period of the trade, kings of Kongo at first observed quite a pronounced distinction between foreign-born captive subject to enslavement and sale in the Atlantic trade and freeborn Kongos who were largely protected from enslavement and sale overseas. In time, however, the distinctions that separated foreign-born and Kongos fell apart as later political authorities and others disregarded such distinctions and all Kongos became subject to enslavement and sale overseas. This was a product of internal Kongo conflicts, which witnessed the collapse of institutions and the redefinition of polity, what it meant to be a citizen or freeborn, and who could be enslaved. (1) <br></br>Afonso was using these slaves as commodity exports because they had monetary value in Portugal. In one case he referred to 50 slaves he sent to Lisbon ‘to buy us the succor that we need’. He also made note of another group of 500 slaves (with an additional 30 in case some of the originals died) that he sent to Lisbon in two large ships whose sale was meant to cover the upkeep of ‘two of our nephews’.22 Moreover, the letter also contains several other references to the Portuguese purchasing slaves, and these references leave no doubt that Kongo already supported markets where slaves were bought and sold. Indeed, the majority of the slaves Kongo exported during Afonso’s reign and for the rest of the sixteenth century were foreign captives obtained from wars Kongo kings and their Portuguese allies waged against the neighboring Mbundu kingdom of Ndongo or in the region of Pamzelungu across the mouth of the Zaire River, as well as the Anzico region around the Malebo Pool (formerly Stanley Pool) on the river. (5) <br></br>Afonso facilitated the trade in slaves by establishing secure markets where Portuguese factors could conduct their business and where his representatives could sell war captives to them. Thus Afonso could continue selling foreign captives and still respect local customs about who could be enslaved. (5) <br></br>Kongo also had rules that restricted the selling of Kongo subjects. For example, in 1526 Afonso wrote to the Portuguese king, Joa˜o III, noting that the numbers of Portuguese traders bringing goods into Kongo had increased and that they were selling their goods directly to unscrupulous Kongo noblemen who no longer relied on him to supply the imports. He complained that some of his vassals were conniving with the Portuguese and were enslaving Kongo subjects, even noblemen. The kidnapping of Kongo subjects so threatened Afonso’s legitimacy that he pleaded with the Portuguese king to order his factors not to send ‘either merchant or merchandise because our will is that in these kingdoms they should not have the trade in slaves nor the departure of them’. (6)
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="35"> In the 1480s, Portuguese ships arrived in Central Africa at the mouth of the Congo River, the center of the Kongo kingdom. Initially, the Kongo were glad to trade with the Portuguese, because the relationship provided a new market for their goods and they received goods from the Portuguese. The Kongo also hoped that the Portuguese would share new technological knowledge. In a few years, however, the Portu­guese traders found that the Kongo could not supply the volume of gold, copper, and other valuable resources that they wanted. After the Portuguese established sugar-cane plantations on nearby islands off the coast of central Af­rica, they found African labor—slaves—to be a much more valuable commodity.In 1506, King Afonso took the throne of the Kongo. Afonso converted to Christianity and returned to become the first black Catholic bishop. He also increased his power and the size of his kingdom by using guns he purchased from the Portuguese.
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="36"> In the first two decades of the sixteenth century, slave exports totaled about 2,300 ~ 2,500 per year, rising to 5,400 per year in 1516 ~ 1521, a level that was maintained at least until the mid-century. This increase was related to the inclusion of the Kingdom of Kongo into the commercial network of the Portuguese and to the development of the island of Sao Tome, located off shore in the Gulf of Guinea, as a transit point for the slave trade and a plantation center for the production of sugarcane. These developments were a further extension of existing commercial practices. Sao Tome became another in a string of depots: Slaves were brought from Kongo to the island for shipment to the Gold Coast, Madeira, the Cape Verde Islands, and Portugal. Between 1510 and 1540, four to six slaving vessels per year were kept occupied hauling slaves to the Gold Coast, for example. Ships varied in size from caravels that could carry 30 to 80 slaves to larger vessels that could transport as many as 100 to 120 slaves. (38) <br></br>Afonso attempted to introduce reforms to increase his power, including the acceptance of Christianity and the reliance on Portuguese advisors. Through border skirmishes and tribute collection, the state acquired slaves for export. Affonso managed the transport of some slaves to Sao Tome through the agency of two members of the royal household who were stationed in Sao Tome in 1526. These efforts at centralization were only partially successful, indeed the theme of Kongo history in the sixteenth century was one of conflict between royal attempts at monopoly and the activities of private traders, both Portuguese and Kongo. On the one side, Afonso directed trade through Sao Salvador and the port of Mpinda, near the mouth of the Congo River. (38) <br></br>A board of inquiry protected official interests by investigating alleged kidnappings, which attempted to restrain the movement of private traders. Private traders, on the other hand, were not to be outdone. The clients of Fernao de Melo, who had the Portuguese charter for Sao Tome, and Antonio Carnciro, who had the charter for Principe, bought slaves wherever they could. (40) <br></br>In the 1520s, exports from Mpinda were on the order of 2,000 to 3,000 per year. By the 1530s, the volume had increased from 4,000 to 5,000 in the same years, and in 1548 to between 6,000 and 7,000. Most of these slaves were sent to Sao Tome, from where they were redistributed elsewhere or used on local plantations. (40)

            <div class="footnotes" id="37"> “Around 1506, Nzinga Mbemba, who took the name Afonso after his baptism, succeeded his father and ruled until about 1543, Afonso promoted European culture by proclaiming Christianity the state religion (a step that affected few of his subjects), imitating the etiquette of Portuguese royalty, and using Portuguese in state business, His son Henrique was educated in Portugal and returned to serve as sub-Saharan Africa’s first black Roman Catholic bishop. European firearms, horses, and cattle were introduced, and Afonso dreamed of achieving a powerful and prosperous state with European help.” (82)<br><br>“Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and the sons of noblemen, and our relatives, and rake them to be sold to the white men who are in our Kingdoms; and for this purpose they have concealed them; and others are brought during the night so that they might not be recognized.” (83)<br><br>“And as soon as they are taken by the white men they are immediately ironed and branded with fire, and when they are carried to be embarked [on ships], if they are caught by our guards’ men the whites allege that they have bought them but they cannot say from whom, so that it is our duty to do justice and to restore to the freemen their freedom, but it cannot be done if your subjects feel offended, as they claim to be. And to avoid such a great evil we passed a law so that any white man living in our Kingdoms and wanting to purchase goods in any way should first inform three of our noblemen and officials of our court whom we rely upon in this matter..”

            <div class="footnotes" id="39">“The best region to illustrate this argument is West-Central Africa, and the best case in the region is the Kingdom of Kongo. This kingdom had never been involved in a trade in people, but it had the capacity to generate captives from outside the polity, and these captives could be sold if conditions made that the best alternative, economically and politically, for the kingdom’s economic and political entrepreneurs. To start, it should be noted that the main initial Kongo trade with the Portuguese was in copper. It was about thirty years after their arrival that the Portu-guese shifted their emphasis from copper to slaves. Even by this time the King of Kongo had no immediately available "disposable people" to sell when the King of Portugal sent a trade mission to prepare the way for large-scale slave exports. As Hilton reports, while the Kongo ruler accepted the new trading arrangement and the gifts from the King of Portugal, he had no slaves to send even as return gifts: There were in fact very few slaves available for purchase and scarcely any had so far been exported from Kongo.

            <div class="footnotes" id="45">“In the language of a later age, King Affonso I was a modernizer. He urgently tried to acquire European learning, weapons, and goods in order to strengthen his rule and fortify it against the destabilizing force of the white arrival. Having noticed the Portuguese appetite for copper, for example, he traded it for European products that would help him buy the submission of outlying provinces. Clearly a man of unusual intelligence, He tried to do something as difficult in his time as in ours: to be a selective modernizer. He was an enthusiast for the church, for the written word, for European medicine, and for woodworking, masonry, and other skills to be learned from Portuguese craftsmen.”(12)<br><br>“He used his fluency in Portuguese to dictate a remarkable series of letters to two successive Portuguese kings, the first known documents composed by a black African in any European language.” (12)<br><br>“Again and again Affonso speaks about the twin themes of the slave trade and the alluring array of cloth, tools, jewelry, and other knickknacks that the Portuguese traders used to buy their human cargoes:” (13)<br><br>“The Portuguese kings showed no sympathy. King Joao III replied: "You ... tell me that you want no slave-trading in your domains, because this trade is depopulating your country. ... The Portuguese there, on the contrary, tell me how vast the Congo is, and how it is so thickly populated that it seems as if no slave has ever left."” (14)
            </div>
            <div class="footnotes" id="46"> “Afonso first traded with the Portuguese via the island of Sao Tome, a quasi-colony of Portugal since the early sixteenth century. In exchange for palm cloth, skins, honey, copper, and ivory, the Mani Kongo received, from the Portuguese, cannons, guns, ammunitions, and luxury goods. But the Portuguese progressively transformed this mercantile economy. ” (106)<br><br>“But Afonso’s repeated complaints were to no avail. The Brazilian plantations were growing, and needed ever-greater number of slaves. Portuguese priests, traders, and adventurers, as well as many of Afonso’s Europeanized vassals, disregarded Afonso’s royal will, undermined the royal monopoly of Kongo’s foreign trade, and plunged into the traffic in slaves. An era of disorders, raids, revolts, endemic.” (106)

            <div class="footnotes" id="47"> “Alonso’s correspondence, and some collaborating evidence, reveal him to be literate, fervently Christian, and anxious to learn as much as possible about Portugal and Europe. He established the Roman Catholic Church in Kongo, provided for its funding, and moreover, studied the religion carefully himself and along with his own advisers and those from Portugal. He sent numerous children to Portugal and Europe to study, including his son Enrique Kinu a Mvemba, who was made a bishop in 1518 and returned to Kongo in 1521. Afonso also created an educational system that made the upper classes literate in Portuguese.” (772)<br><br>“The arrival of the Portuguese navigator Diogo Cao at the mouth of the Zaire in 1483 took the Kongolese by surprise. Although it was a large, growing, and powerful kingdom, Kongo had no contacts with the world beyond its immediate neighbors and the extent of its regional trade routes before the Portuguese arrived. Nevertheless, Kongo rapidly accepted the newcomers and quickly moved to integrate itself into the Atlantic and European world. Kongo’s earliest relationship with Portugal is studied with the intention of understanding a pristine encounter between African and European, akin to the meeting of the Tainos with Columbus less than a decade. Later.” (772)<br><br>“ These neighbors included Mpanzulumhu, located near the mouth of the Zaire, Klapp la on the coast north of Luanda, and probably also the kingdom of Ndongo to his south. In all these areas, Kongo had limited control in precontact times, and the growing Portuguese trade represented both assertions of independence on the part of the African partners and tax evasion on the part..” (772)<br><br>“Whatever the specific events he alluded to, there is little evidence that Kongo’s sovereignty was substantially undermined, or that Afonso’s reign was a noble failure to transform the country, as some scholars have contended, When Alfonso died in 1542. he passed on a country that was stable, expanding its influence and authority, and committed to continuing the Christian faith. It would be over a century before the debilitating civil war that actually did destroy the country would begin.” (772)

            <div class="footnotes" id="48"> “Sir, Your I Highness should know how our Kingdom is being lost in so many ways that it is convenient to provide for the necessary remedy since this is caused by the excessive freedom given by your factors and officials to the men and merchants who are allowed to come to this Kingdom to set up shops with goods and many things which have been prohibited by us, and which they spread throughout our Kingdoms and Domains in such an abundance that many of our vassals, whom we had in obedience, do not comply because they have the things in greater abundance than we ourselves; and it was with these things that we had them content and subjected under our vassalage and jurisdiction, so it is doing a great harm not only to the service of God, but to the security and peace of our Kingdoms and State as well. And we cannot reckon how great the damage is since the mentioned merchants are taking every day our natives, sons of the land and sons of our noblemen and vassals and our relatives, because the thieves and men of had conscience grab them wishing to have the things and wares of this Kingdom which they are ambitious of; they grab them and get them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the corruption and licentiousness that our country is being com-pletely depopulated, and Your Highness should not agree with this or accept it as in your service. “ (26)

            ><br /><br />Mvemba a Nzinga or Nzinga Mbemba (c. 1456–1542 or 1543),
            also known as King Afonso I, was a ruler of the Kingdom of Kongo in
            the first half of the 16th century. He reigned over the Kongo Empire
            from 1509 to late 1542 or 1543.<br /><br /><b>Reign</b
            ><br /><br />Virtually all that is known about Kongo in the time of
            Afonso’s reign is known from his long series of letters, written in
            Portuguese, primarily to the kings Manuel I and João III of Portugal.
            The letters are often very long and give many details about the
            administration of the country. Many letters complain about the
            behavior of several Portuguese officials, and these letters have given
            rise to an interpretation of Afonso’s reign as one in which Portuguese
            interests submerged Afonso’s ambitions.<br /><br />He reigned over the
            Kongo Empire from 1509 to late 1542 or 1543. During this time Afonso I
            had an increasingly awkward relationship with Portugal. This
            relationship came to a head during the latter half of the 1520s when
            the Kongo slave trade was at its peak, a direct result of Portuguese
            traders violating the law of Afonso I concerning who could and who
            could not be sold as a slave. The Portuguese actively subverted Afonso
            I by going through his vassals. Afonso I expressed a great deal of
            irritation with the Portuguese in a letter he wrote in 1514. In this
            letter Afonso I openly stated he would like to have full control of
            the Kongo-Portuguese slave trade. The Portuguese did not approve of
            this measure and the situation progressively got worse. The slave
            trade continued unabated until it was resolved in 1526. Afonso I in
            1526 created a commission to investigate the origin of any individual
            who was to be sold as a slave. This helped put an end to the illegal
            slave trade occurring in the Kongo. <br /><br />Although Afonso was
            outspokenly opposed to slavery and initially fought the Portuguese
            demand for human beings, he eventually relented in order to sustain
            the economy of the Kongo. Initially Afonso sent war captives and
            criminals to be sold as slaves to the Portuguese. Eventually
            Portuguese demand for slaves exceeded the country’s potential supply,
            prompting them to search for slaves in neighboring regions.<br /><br />Afonso
            let this situation continue for as long as it did in an attempt to not
            be overtly rude to the Portuguese, as he had actively required their
            help to solve various conflicts within his Kingdom. Afonso I also had
            been attempting to resolve the situation diplomatically through
            letters to the Vatican as well as to Portugal. The responses told him
            that they had little intention of altering the actions of the
            Portuguese traders. The Portuguese regarded the slave trade as nothing
            more than typical commerce. This is why the commission was
            established. The Portuguese showed clear disdain with the condition of
            the slave economics of the Kongo and made a failed attempt to
            assassinate Afonso I in 1540. <br /><br />During his reign Afonso I
            leveraged other desirable resources to consolidate his power and to
            maintain the status quo with Portugal, mainly gold, iron, and copper.
            These resources were the bargaining chips that allowed Afonso I to
            negotiate with the Portuguese, but also to insulate himself from them
            as well to a lesser extent. <br /><br />In Adam Hochschild’s 1998 book
            King Leopold’s Ghost, Hochschild characterizes Afonso as a "selective
            modernizer" because he welcomed European scientific innovation and the
            church but refused to adopt Portugal’s legal code and sell land to
            prospectors. In fact, Afonso ridiculed the Ordenações Manuelinas (new
            Portuguese law code) when he read it in 1516, asking the Portuguese
            emissary de Castro, "What is the punishment, Castro, for putting one’s
            feet on the ground?" No contemporary record mentions anything about
            land sales, indeed land in Kongo was never sold to anyone.

            ><br /><br />Manuel I (European Portuguese: [mɐnuˈɛɫ]; 31 May 1469 –
            13 December 1521), the Fortunate (Port. o Afortunado), King of
            Portugal, was the son of Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu, by his wife, the
            Infanta Beatrice of Portugal. His name is associated with a period of
            Portuguese history distinguished by significant achievements both in
            political affairs and in the arts. In spite of Portugal’s small size
            and population in comparison to the great European land powers of
            France, Italy and even Spain, the classical Portuguese Armada was the
            largest in the world at the time. During Manuel’s reign Portugal was
            able to acquire an overseas empire of vast proportions, the first in
            world history to reach global dimensions. The landmark symbol of the
            period was the Portuguese discovery of Brazil and South America in
            April 1500. <br /><br /><b>Imperial Growth</b><br /><br />Manuel would
            prove a worthy successor to his cousin John II for his support of
            Portuguese exploration of the Atlantic Ocean and development of
            Portuguese commerce. During his reign, the following achievements were
            realized:
            <blockquote>
              - 1498 – The discovery of a maritime route to India by Vasco da
              Gama. <br />- 1500 – The discovery of Brazil by Pedro Álvares
              Cabral.<br />- 1501 – The discovery of Labrador by Gaspar and Miguel
              Corte-Real.<br />- 1505 – The appointment of Francisco de Almeida as
              the first viceroy of India.<br />- 1503–1515 – The establishment of
              monopolies on maritime trade routes to the Indian Ocean and Persian
              Gulf by Afonso de Albuquerque, an admiral, for the benefit of
              Portugal.
            </blockquote>
            The capture of Malacca in modern-day Malaysia in 1511 was the result
            of a plan by Manuel I to thwart the Muslim trade in the Indian Ocean
            by capturing Aden, blocking trade through Alexandria, capturing Ormuz
            to block trade through the Persian Gulf and Beirut, and capturing
            Malacca to control trade with China.<br /><br />All these events made
            Portugal wealthy from foreign trade as it formally established a vast
            overseas empire. Manuel used the wealth to build a number of royal
            buildings (in the "Manueline" style) and to attract scientists and
            artists to his court. Commercial treaties and diplomatic alliances
            were forged with Ming dynasty of China and the Persian Safavid
            dynasty. Pope Leo X received a monumental embassy from Portugal during
            his reign designed to draw attention to Portugal’s newly acquired
            riches to all of Europe.

            ><br /><br />John III (Portuguese: João III Portuguese pronunciation:
            [ʒuˈɐ̃w̃]; 7 June 1502 – 11 June 1557) nicknamed The Colonizer
            (Portuguese: "o Colonizador") was the King of Portugal and the
            Algarves from 13 December 1521 to 11 June 1557. He was the son of King
            Manuel I and Maria of Aragon, the third daughter of King Ferdinand II
            of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. John succeeded his father
            in 1521, at the age of nineteen. <br /><br />During his rule,
            Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and in the New World
            through the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. John III’s policy of
            reinforcing Portugal’s bases in India (such as Goa) secured Portugal’s
            monopoly over the spice trade of cloves and nutmeg from the Maluku
            Islands, as a result of which John III has been called the "Grocer
            King". On the eve of his death in 1557, the Portuguese empire had a
            global dimension and spanned almost 1 billion acres (about 4 million
            square kilometers). <br /><br />During his reign, the Portuguese
            became the first Europeans to make contact with both China, under the
            Ming dynasty, and Japan, during the Muromachi period. He abandoned
            Muslim territories in North Africa in favor of trade with India and
            investment in Brazil. In Europe, he improved relations with the Baltic
            region and the Rhineland, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese
            trade.

            claim that Africa is a barbaric, uncivilized place while associating
            European states with class and nobility, but many of these accounts
