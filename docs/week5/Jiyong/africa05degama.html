          <p>
            1497 The Bay of St. Helena [on the west coast of the present country
            of South Africa]. On Tuesday (November 7) we returned to the land,
            which we found to be low, with a broad bay opening into it. The
            captain-major [i.e., da Gama speaking in the third person] sent Pero
            d'Alenquer in a boat to take soundings and to search for good
            anchoring ground. The bay was found to be very clean, and to afford
            shelter against all winds except those from the N.W. It extended
            east and west, and <b><a>we named it Santa Helena</a></b
            >. <br />
            <br />

              src="images/Da_Gama_Monument-Ursula_.jpg"
              alt="Modern image of Santa Helena"
            /><br />
            <br />
            On Wednesday (November 8) we cast anchor in this bay, and we
            remained there eight days, cleaning the ships, mending the sails,
            and taking in wood. The river Samtiagua (S. Thiago) enters the bay
            four leagues to the S.E. of the anchorage. It comes from the
            interior (sertao), is about a stone's throw across at the mouth, and
            from two to three fathoms in depth at all states of the tide. The
            inhabitants of this country are tawny-colored. Their food is
            confined to the flesh of seals, whales and gazelles, and the roots
            of herbs. They are dressed in skins, and wear sheaths over their
            virile members. They are armed with poles of olive wood to which a
            horn, browned in the fire, is attached.
            <a
              >Their numerous dogs resemble those of Portugal, and bark like
              them. The birds of the country, likewise, are the same as in
              Portuga</a
            >
            <a><b>l,</b></a> and include cormorants, gulls, turtle doves,
            crested larks, and many others.
            <a
              >The climate is healthy and temperate, and produces good
              herbage</a
            >. On the day after we had cast anchor, that is to say on Thursday
            (November 9), we landed with the captain-major, and took
            <a>captive</a> one of the natives, who was small of stature like
            <a>Sancho Mexia</a>. This man had been gathering honey in the sandy
            waste, for in this country the bees deposit their honey at the foot
            of the mounds around the bushes. He was taken on board the
            captain-major's ship, and being placed at the table, he ate of all
            we ate. On the following day the captain-major had him well dressed
            and sent ashore.
          </p>
          <img src="images/a3174d14e9f817e93dec975e424380.jpeg" alt="" />

          <p>
            On the following day (November 10) fourteen or fifteen natives came
            to where our ship lay. The captain-major landed and
            <a
              >showed them a variety of merchandise, with the view of finding
              out whether such things were to be found in their country. This
              merchandise included cinnamon,</a
            >
            cloves, seed-pearls, gold, and many other things, but it was evident
            that they had no knowledge whatsoever of such articles, and they
            were consequently given round bells and tin rings. This happened on
            Friday, and the like took place on Saturday. On Sunday (November 12)
            about forty or fifty natives made their appearance, and having
            dined, we landed, and in exchange for the with which we came
            provided, we obtained shells, which they wore as ornaments in their
            ears, and which looked as if they had been plated, and foxtails
            attached to a handle, with which they fanned their faces. The
            captain-major also acquired for one
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="SU1"> çeitil </a> one of the sheaths which
            they wore over their members, and this seemed to show that they
            valued <a data-ip-footnote-id="SU2">copper</a> very highly; indeed,
            they wore small beads of that metal in their ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            On that day Fernao Velloso, who was with the captain-major,
            expressed a great desire to be
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="SU12">
              permitted to accompany the natives to their houses, so that he
              might find out how they lived and what they ate.
            </a>
            The captain-major yielded to his importunities, and allowed him to
            accompany them, and when we returned to the captain-major's vessel
            to sup, he went away with the negroes. Soon after they had left us
            they caught a seal, and when they came to the foot of a hill in a
            barren place they roasted it, and gave some of it to Fernao Velloso,
            as also some of the roots which they eat. After this meal
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Q1"
              >they expressed a desire that he should not accompany them any
              further,</a
            >
            but return to the vessels. When Fernao Velloso came abreast of the
            vessels he began to shout, the negroes keeping in the bush.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were still at supper; but when his shouts were heard the
            captain-major rose at once, and so did we others, and we entered a
            sailing boat. The negroes then began running along the beach, and
            they came as quickly up with Fernao Velloso as we did, and when we
            endeavored to get him into the boat they threw their assegais, and
            wounded the captain-major and three or four others. All this
            happened because we
            <a
              >looked upon these people as men of little spirit, quite incapable
              of violence</a
            >, and had therefore landed without first arming ourselves. We then
            returned to the ships.

            <a

          ><br /><br />Vasco da Gama, 1st Count of Vidigueira; c. 1460s – 24
          December 1524), was a Portuguese explorer and the first European to
          reach India by sea. His initial voyage to India (1497–1499) was the
          first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the
          Atlantic and the Indian oceans and therefore, the West and the Orient.
          <br /><br />Da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India was
          significant and opened the way for an age of global imperialism and
          for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in
          Asia. Traveling the ocean route allowed the Portuguese to avoid
          sailing across the highly disputed Mediterranean and traversing the
          dangerous Arabian Peninsula. The sum of the distances covered in the
          outward and return voyages made this expedition the longest ocean
          voyage ever made until then, far longer than a full voyage around the
          world by way of the Equator.<br /><br />After decades of sailors
          trying to reach the Indies, with thousands of lives and dozens of
          vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, da Gama landed in Calicut on
          20 May 1498. Unopposed access to the Indian spice routes boosted the
          economy of the Portuguese Empire, which was previously based along
          northern and coastal West Africa. The main spices at first obtained
          from Southeast Asia were pepper and cinnamon, but soon included other
          products, all new to Europe. Portugal maintained a commercial monopoly
          of these commodities for several decades. It was not until a century
          later that other European powers, namely the Dutch Republic and
          England, followed by France and Denmark, were able to challenge
          Portugal’s monopoly and naval supremacy in the Cape Route.
          <br /><br />Da Gama led two of the Portuguese India Armadas, the first
          and the fourth. The latter was the largest and departed for India four
          years after his return from the first one. For his contributions, in
          1524 da Gama was appointed Governor of India, with the title of
          Viceroy, and was ennobled as Count of Vidigueira in 1519. Vasco da
          Gama remains a leading figure in the history of exploration. Numerous
          homages have been made worldwide to celebrate his explorations and
          accomplishments. The Portuguese national epic poem, Os Lusíadas, was
          written in his honour by Camões (d.1580). His first trip to India is
          widely considered a milestone in world history, as it marked the
          beginning of a sea-based phase of global multiculturalism.
          <br /><br />In March 2016 thousands of artifacts and nautical remains
          were recovered from the wreck of the ship Esmeralda, one of da Gama’s
          armada, found off the coast of Oman.

          ><br /><br />On 8 July 1497 Vasco da Gama led a fleet of four ships
          with a crew of 170 men from Lisbon. The distance traveled in the
          journey around Africa to India and back was greater than around the
          equator. The navigators included Portugal’s most experienced, Pero de
          Alenquer, Pedro Escobar, João de Coimbra, and Afonso Gonçalves. It is
          not known for certain how many people were in each ship’s crew but
          approximately 55 returned, and two ships were lost. Two of the vessels
          were carracks, newly built for the voyage; the others were a caravel
          and a supply boat.<br /><br /><b>Journey to the Cape</b
          ><br /><br />The expedition set sail from Lisbon on 8 July 1497. It
          followed the route pioneered by earlier explorers along the coast of
          Africa via Tenerife and the Cape Verde Islands. After reaching the
          coast of present-day Sierra Leone, da Gama took a course south into
          the open ocean, crossing the Equator and seeking the South Atlantic
          westerlies that Bartolomeu Dias had discovered in 1487. This course
          proved successful and on 4 November 1497, the expedition made landfall
          on the African coast. For over three months the ships had sailed more
          than 10,000 kilometres (6,000 mi) of open ocean, by far the longest
          journey out of sight of land made by that time.<br /><br />By 16
          December, the fleet had passed the Great Fish River (Eastern Cape,
          South Africa) – where Dias had anchored – and sailed into waters
          previously unknown to Europeans. With Christmas pending, da Gama and
          his crew gave the coast they were passing the name Natal, which
          carried the connotation of "birth of Christ" in Portuguese.
          <br /><br /><b>Return</b><br /><br />The expedition had exacted a
          large cost – two ships and over half the men had been lost. It had
          also failed in its principal mission of securing a commercial treaty
          with Calicut. Nonetheless, the small quantities of spices and other
          trade goods brought back on the remaining two ships demonstrated the
          potential of great profit for future trade. Vasco da Gama was justly
          celebrated for opening a direct sea route to Asia. His path would be
          followed up thereafter by yearly Portuguese India Armadas.
          <br /><br />The spice trade would prove to be a major asset to the
          Portuguese royal treasury, and other consequences soon followed. For
          example, da Gama’s voyage had made it clear that the east coast of
          Africa, the Contra Costa, was essential to Portuguese interests; its
          ports provided fresh water, provisions, timber, and harbors for
          repairs, and served as a refuge where ships could wait out unfavorable
          weather. One significant result was the colonization of Mozambique by
          the Portuguese Crown.
