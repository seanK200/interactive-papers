            <b>In-Class Collective Analysis:</b> <a>[Part 1]</a>, <a>[Part 2]</a>
            <p>
              In the year 1505, on 25 March, Tuesday, the feast of the
              Annunciation of Our Lady, Dom Francisco d'Almeida sailed with a
              fleet of twenty vessels. There were fourteen large men-of-war and
              six caravels.
            </p>
            <p>
              They rounded the <a>Cape of Good Hope</a> on 20 June and were driven
              away from it seventy leagues. On 2 July there were great storms with
              thunder, and two men from the flagship and one from the Lyomarda
              fell overboard. On 18 July they sighted land for the first time, 369
              leagues beyond the Cape of Good Hope, near the Ylhas Darradeiras,
              which are thirty leagues from <a>the island of Mozambique</a>. On 19
              July they were in sight of Mozambique, and on 21 July they were
              crossing the shallow waters of Sam Rafael, which are thirty
              <a>leagues</a>
              from Kilwa.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Tuesday, 22 July, they entered the harbour of Kilwa at noon, with
              a total of eight ships. Immediately on their arrival the
              Grand-Captain, Dom Francisco d'Almeida, sent Bona Ajuta Veneziano to
              summon the king. He excused himself from coming, but sent the
              Grand-Captain gifts instead; They were five goats, a small cow and a
              large number of coconuts and other fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next flay the Grand-Captain ordered the ships to have their
              artillery in readiness. Then the captains, each in his best clothes,
              and full armour, went in his own boat to lie off the town in the
              hope that the king would decide to come out. The <a>sheikh</a>,
              however, sent a message to say that he could not come since he had
              guests, but, if required, he would send the tribute due to the King
              of Portugal. This message was brought by a party of five Moors, who
              were immediately seized.
            </p>
            <p>
              At dawn on Thursday, 24 July, the vigil of the feast of St. James the Apostle, all went in their boats to the shore. The first to land was the Grand-Captain, and he was followed by the others. They went straight to the royal palace, <a>and on the way only those Moors who did not fight were granted their lives</a>. At the <a>palace</a> there was a Moor leaning out of the window with a Portuguese flag in his hand, shouting: ‘Portugal! Portugal!’ This flag had been left behind by the admiral [Vasco da Gama] when he had arranged for Kilwa to pay a tribute of 1,500 ounces of gold a year. The Moor was asked to open the door, and, when he did not do so, the door was broken down with axes. They found neither the Moor nor anyone else in the Palace, which was deserted.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Kilwa there are many strong houses several storeys high. They are built of stone and mortar and plastered with various designs. As soon as the town had been taken without opposition, the Vicar-General and some of the Franciscan fathers came ashore carrying two crosses in procession and singing the Te Deum. They went to the palace, and there the cross was put down and the Grand-Captain prayed. Then everyone started to plunder the town of all its merchandise and provisions.
            </p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/%27Portrait_of_a_Moor%27_by_Jan_Mostaert.jpg/812px-%27Portrait_of_a_Moor%27_by_Jan_Mostaert.jpg" alt="portrait_of_a_moor">
                
            <p>
              <a>The town of Kilwa lies on an island around which ships of 500 tons can sail.</a>
              The island and town have a population of 4,000 people. It is very
              fertile and produces maize similar to that of Guinea, butter, honey,
              and wax. On the trees hang beehives like jars of three almudes
              capacity, each closed with woven palm leaves. There are holes
              through which the bees go in and come out.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              There are many trees and palms here and <a>on the mainland</a>, some
              of them different from those of Portugal. From the island to the
              mainland the distance is in some places two leagues and in others
              one.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are sweet oranges, lemons, vegetables, small onions, and
              aromatic herbs. They are grown in gardens and watered with water
              from the wells. Here also grows betel which has leaves like ivy and
              is grown like peas with sticks at the root for support. The leaf is
              used by the wealthy Arabs for chewing together with specially
              prepared limes which look like an ointment. They keep the leaves as
              if they were to be put on wounds. These leaves make the mouth and
              teeth very red, but are said to be most refreshing.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are more black slaves than white Moors here: they are engaged
              on farms growing maize and other things. <a data-ip-footnote-id="There are"> There are various types of
              peas which are produced by plants as high as large pepper trees;
              when they are ripe, they are gathered and stored. The soil is red,
              the top layer being sandy; the grass is always green.</a> There are many
              fat beasts, oxen, cows, sheep, and goats and also plenty of fish;
              there are also whales which swim round the ships. There is no
              running drinking water on the island. Near the island there are
              other small islands which are inhabited. There are many boats as
              large as a caravel of fifty tons and other smaller ones. The large
              ones lie aground on the shore and are dragged down to the sea when
              the people wish to sail them. They are built without nails: the
              planks are sewn together with rope made from knotted coir from the
              coconut palm. The same kind of rope is used for the rudder. The
              boats are caulked with black pitch made from crude incense and
              resin. They sail from here to Sofala, 255 leagues away.
            </p>
            <p>
              The palms here do not produce dates but from some of them wine and
              vinegar are obtained. These come from the palm trees which do not
              produce coconuts. The coconuts are the size of large melons, and
              from the fibres inside the shell all kinds of rope are made. Inside
              the shell is a fruit the size of a large pineapple. It contains half
              a pint of milk which is very pleasant to drink. When the milk has
              been drunk the nut is broken and eaten; the kernel tastes like a
              walnut which is not fully ripe. They dry it and it yields a large
              quantity of oil.
            </p>
            <p>People here sleep raised above the ground in hammocks made of palm leaves in which only one person can lie.</p>
            <p>The Portuguese found here a large quantity of pure drinking water. Flasks of very good perfume are exported from here and a large quantity of glass of all types and all kinds of cotton piece-goods, incense, resin, gold, silver, and pearls. The Grand-Captain ordered the loot to be deposited under seal in a house.</p>
            <p>The fortress of Kilwa was built out of the best house there was. All the other houses around it were pulled down. It was fortified and guns were set in place with everything else a fort needs. Pero Ferreira was left in command of it with eighty men.</p>
            <p>The country is not very hot. The men are armed with bows and large arrows, strong shields of palm leaves bound with cotton, and pikes better than those of Guinea. Few swords were seen. They have four catapults for hurling stones but do not yet know the use of gunpowder.</p>
            <p>The sea laps the entrance of the fortress at high water near where the ships enter.</p>
            <p>When the king fled from Kilwa, the Grand Captain appointed another, a local Moor beloved by all, whom they took in procession on horseback through the town.</p>
            <p>Lime is prepared here in this manner: large logs of wood are piled in a circle and inside them coral limestone is placed; then the wood is burnt. The process after that is the same as in Portugal.</p>
            <p>Cotton is found in abundance. It is of good quality and is planted and grows well in the island. The sheep have wool no better than goats. The slaves wear a cotton cloth round the waist and down to the knees; the rest of the body is naked. The white Arabs and slave owners wear two pieces of cotton cloth, one round the waist down to the feet and the other thrown over the shoulders and reaching down as far as where the first cloth is tied.</p>
            <p>They have copper coins like our ceptis, four being equal to one real; Portuguese coins have the same value there as at home. There are no gold coins but the weight of their mitical is equal to 460 reis in Portugal.</p>
            <p>The winter season in Kilwa is from April to September. It is not cold and for this reason the people wear scanty clothes.</p>
            <p>The Grand-Captain twice went from one side of the town to the other. Once he saw twenty-five gazelle which had been let loose on the island. There are also many wild cats in the bush.</p>
            <p>There are many vaulted mosques, one of which is like that of Cordova. All the upper-class Moors carry a <a>rosary</a>.</p>

          <b>(SU)</b> I'm quite confused here... Did they mistake an island as
          Mozambique, or was there an island called Mozambique at the time but
          now it has become a country's name? Or does it indicate an island near
          Mozambique?

        <div class="footnote hide-id" id="and on the way only those Moors who did not fight were granted their lives">
          <b>(Q)</b> So they went in by force. They don’t seem to care that much whether the inhabitants will like them or not for doing so. Does this mean that they regarded kilwa solely as a money-making enterprise and not a place where they needed to appear nice enough to rule? Was it not a place where they wanted to settle long-term? <br />(A) According to the African History book, that had had been how they unfortunately ruled Africa, if we can call it "ruling". They cared about material gains rather than making the African populace educated and enlightened like Europeans.  This was the purported reason of colonialism. Civilizing the "negro savages", in the words of colonialists.

            merchants and sailors.

He distinguished himself as a counsellor to King John II of Portugal and later in the wars against the Moors and in the conquest of Granada in 1492. In 1505 he was appointed as the first governor and viceroy of the Portuguese State of India (Estado da Índia). Almeida is credited with establishing Portuguese hegemony in the Indian Ocean, with his victory at the naval Battle of Diu in 1509. Before Almeida could return to Portugal, he lost his life in 1510. His son Lourenço de Almeida was also killed in the Battle of Chaul.<br><br>In 1505 King Manuel I of Portugal appointed Almeida, then in his mid 50s, as the first viceroy of Portuguese India (Estado da Índia).[1] With an armada of 22 ships, including 14 carracks and 6 caravels, Almeida departed from Lisbon on 25 March 1505. The armada carried a crew of 1,500 soldiers. The flagship was the carrack São Rafael captained by Fernão Soares. The mission’s primary aims were to bring the spice trade under Portuguese control, to build forts along the east African and Indian coasts, to further Portuguese spice trade through alliances with local chieftains, besides constructing trading posts.
