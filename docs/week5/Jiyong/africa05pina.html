            <b>The first convert to Christianity (1488)</b><br>
            <br>
            <blockquote>Religion, trade, and politics were inextricably linked from the very
            beginning of contact between Portuguese and Africans. The Portuguese
            proselytized in the name of Christianity as they <a data-ip-footnote-id="sought allies">sought allies
            against Muslim trading competitors</a> and political enemies and a way
            to <a data-ip-footnote-id="secure the">secure the support of the papacy.</a> The new religion had distinct
            attractions for some Africans, especially those who saw it as a
            political ideology that would gain them knew allies in their own
            contest for power within Africa. In 1488, Bemoym, King of Jalofo (at
            the mouth of the Senegal River), who was a Muslim, and the newly
            arrived Portuguese found that they had 
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="interests in common">interests in common</a> –
            Bemoym to regain his kingdom with Portuguese arms, the Portuguese to
            establish a base on the coast. Neither party expected the outcome
            that resulted.</blockquote>
          </p>
          </p>
        And this year one thousand four hundred and eighty-eight, while the king [John II] 
        was in Setuvel [Setubal], he made <a>a Christian of Bemoym</a>, a negro prince of the kingdom 
        of Gelof [Jalofo], which is at the entrance of the Rio de Çanaga [Senegal] in Guinee. 
        His motives and reasons for this and the manner of doing it were <a>briefly and truthfully as 
        follows</a>. During the previous year, while Gonçalo Coelho, a dependant of the king, was trafficking 
        at the mouth of the said River, the said Bemoym, who at that time with prosperity and great power 
        governed the said kingdom of Gelof, was informed through the interpreters of the royal perfection 
        and the many virtues of the king, and desiring to <a>serve</a> him, through the said Gonçalo Coelho he sent 
        him a rich present of gold one hundred slaves, all young men, with some products of his land. This man, 
        by virtue of a huge manilla of gold, which he gave the king as a letter of credence, <a>according to his 
        custom of being illiterate</a>, sent to him to ask for arms and ships; to which the king refused consent with 
        <a>just</a> reasons, based on the excommunications and the apostolic prohibitions, <a>since he [Bemoym] was not a Christian</a>. 
        Then in this year, because the said Bemoym was treacherously driven out of his kingdom, he determined to embark on 
        one of the caravels of the trade, which frequent the coast, and to come in person to seek aid, assistance 
        and justice from the king, who was in Setuvel. Bemoym arrived in Lixboa, accompanied by some negroes of 
        his own royal blood and sons of persons closely related to men of importance. When the King had been <a>informed 
        of their arrival</a>, he commanded that they should come to be entertained at Palmella, where he forthwith commanded his 
        men to make abundant provision for him and to serve him with silver and attendance and every other civility which was 
        proper to his station. Also he commanded all to be given rich and fine clothes to wear, according to the quality 
        and merit of their persons demanded. <a>And when they were in a condition to come up to court</a>, the king sent and horses 
        and mules, very well apparelled, to them all; and on the day when they were to make their entrance, the king commanded that 
        Bemoym should be received by Dom Francisco Coutinho, Count of Marialva, and with him all lords and nobleman of the court, 
        whom the king purposely ordered to be robed and adorned as well as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
          The king was lodged in the House of the exchequer of the said town,
          and the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="blueberries">queen in other houses</a> next to
          him, and both residences were all furnished and decorated with very
          expensive cloths of silk and serge and provided with a royal dais with
          a canopy of brocade. With the king was the duke Dom Manuel,
          accompanied by many titled lords and bishops and many other nobles,
          robed with much gentility and exact perfection. With the queen was the
          prince, her son, because it was ordained that one should forthwith
          visit the queen immediately after seeing and speaking with the king.
          The king and the duke adorned their persons with very rich robes of
          their authority, all trimmed with gold and many precious stones.
          Bemoym appeared to be forty years old, and he was a man of great
          stature, very dark, with a very long beard, limbs all well
          proportioned and a very
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="witch hazel">gracious presence</a>; and being
          dressed, he entered the king’s rooms, and the king came forward two or
          three paces from the dais to receive him, raising his cap a little.
          Then he led him to the dais, on which there was a throne; but the king
          did not sit thereon, and, leaning against it, thus on foot gave ear to
          him. 
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="Then the said"> Then the said Bemoym and all his men threw themselves at his feet
          to kiss them, and they made a show of taking the earth from under them
          and</a>, in token of their subjection and his overlordship and of their
          great respect, threw it over their heads. But the king with much honor
          and courtesy made him rise, and through the negro
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="cranberries">interpreters</a>, who are already
          present for this purpose, commanded him to speak. Thereupon, Bemoym
          with great ease, majesty and considerable gravity made a public
          speech, which lasted for a long time, and he used such notable words
          and sentences in support of his case that they did not seem to come
          from a savage negro but from Prince Grego,
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="apple sauce">educated in Athenas</a>. The
          substance of his speech was to recount to the king with swift sighs
          and many tears the tale of his miserable ill-fortune, caused by that
          treason which had been directed against him in his kingdom, and he
          declared this at large. Furthermore, he said that he was only
          reminding the king of this, because he was confident in the hope of
          revenge, aid and assistance and above all justice for he alone in the
          world could an ought to give it to him, since not only was he so
          noble, powerful, just and pious a king, but also principally he was
          lord of Guinee, to whom he, as his vassal, came, seeking assistance,
          justice and mercy; also he said that in the event of his royal
          escutcheon being richly decorated to his glory and praise with
          evidence of his victories over kings, it would also now be embellished
          with memorials of the kings whom he had made; the former would be
          primarily the accidental benefit of good fortune, whereas the latter
          would be the result of his own goodness and greatness of heart.
          Moreover, <a data-ip-footnote-id="sweetpea">he said</a> to him: “Most
          powerful lord, God knows how, when I heard of thy greatness and the
          royal virtues, my spirits were always eager and my eyes desirous to
          see thee; and I do not know why it was, because the more it pleased
          me, when I was free and in all my prosperity, the less do my overthrow
          an exile, by their sad condition, justify my faith and my words; but,
          if it were thus ordained from above that I should not come and do it
          so well in other circumstances more favorable to me , since it was
          ordained for me to see thee, I praise God fervently for my ruin; and
          this gladness already so satisfies me that I shall not return from
          this journey discontented.”
      </P>
      <p>
          Proceeding further in a word, he said that, if perhaps in reply to
          his petition for justice and help men should deny that he was a
          Christian, even as upon other occasions word had been sent to him by
          way of an excuse for refusing another similar request, there should
          now be no doubt or contradiction about it, because he and all his
          men who are present, among whom there were not wanting men of noble
          and royal birth, advised at other times by His holy warnings, had
          come in order that in his kingdoms and at his hands they might at
          once become Christians. He <a>said that</a> the only sorrow and
          truly great anxiety, which they had thereby experienced, arose out
          of the fact that it seemed that the force of his necessity rather
          than of his faith had caused him to do it. With these he coupled
          many other sound reasons touching his purpose. Then the king replied
          to him in a few words, and devoted great care and much wisdom to
          everything, expressing great pleasure at their meeting and even more
          pleasure at his final intention to be a Christian. Therefore he gave
          him hope in this world of assistance in his cause and of restoration
          to his kingdom and another that of glory and eternal salvation.
          Thereupon, he dismissed him, and Bemoym went to speak to the queen
          and to the prince, before whom he made a short speech, in which with
          shrewd judgment and very natural dignity he asked them for a favor
          and assistance with the King. The queen and the prince dismissed
          him, <a>shewing</a> him much honour and kindness. Then, on another
          day, Bemoym came to speak with the king, and, alone and apart, with
          an interpreter, they both conversed for a long time. Here Bemoym
          again recounted his affairs with great prudence; and he also replied
          very wisely and exactly to the questions which the king asked him,
          and the king remained very satisfied with this. In his honour the
          king ordered both fights and tournaments, and he held fancy
          dress-balls and dances, and in order that he might see them he gave
          orders for a chair to be placed at the upper end of the state room
          opposite the king. Moreover, it was the king’s wish that Bemoym
          before becoming a Christian, should first be instructed in matters
          of the faith; for Bemoym was of the sect of Malamede [Muhammad] in
          whom he believed, because of his being a neighbour of, and dealer
          with, the Azanegues, and he had some knowledge of the contents of
          the Bible. For these reasons, theologians and learned men conversed
          with him and taught and advised him. Then it was decided that he
          should see and listen to a mass for the king, and this mass was said
          in pontifical and with great formality and ceremonial in the church
          of Santa Maria de Todoslos Santos. Bemoym with his men and with
          learned Christians was in the choir, and, at the elevation of the
          body of Our Lord, when he saw all on their knees with their hands
          raised in the act of prayer, his hand went up to the cap which he
          had on his head; and thus, like everybody, with his knees on the
          ground and his head uncovered, he prayed. Then he said with many
          indications of truth that the remorse, which he experienced in his
          heart in that hour, he took as clear proof that this was the only
          true God of salvation. Then for two days the king proceeded to
          banquet publicly, for which purpose he put on his robes and he
          commanded that the house and the table were to be furnished with
          plate and tapestries, dishes and service, and there were to be
          minstrels and dances, and all in great perfection; for the king was
          deliberately very particular and exact about ceremonial above all in
          matters touching his estate. At the second hour of the night of the
          third day of the month of November, the said Bemoym, and six of the
          principal persons who had come with him, became Christians in the
          chamber of the queen, which was decorated for the occasion with
          elaborate formality.
        </p>

            His godfathers were the king, the queen, the prince, the duke, a
            commissary of the pope who was at the court, and the bishop of
            Tanger who at the time was the licentiate Caçadilha. Dom Justo,
            bishop of <a>Cepta</a>, who in pontifical performed the office,
            baptized them, and Bemoym received the name Dom Joham for love of
            the king. Moreover, on the seventh day of November, the king dubbed
            him a knight; and twenty-four others of his men were made Christians
            in the counting-house of the said town. The king gave him a
            coat-of-arms consisting of a golden cross on a red field surrounded
            by the escutcheon of the arms of Portugal. On this same day, in a
            solemn act and speaking as a great lord be rendered obedience and
            paid homage to the king. Also he sent another submission, written in
            Latin, to the pope, wherein he gave an account of his case and of
            his conversion to the faith in words of deep devotion and high
            praise to the king. The king determined to give him help and
            assistance, and gave him twenty armed caravels. The captain of the
            caravels was Pero Vaaz da Cunha, who
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]"
              >carried orders to build at the entrance of the Rio da Çanaga a
              fortress, which was not to be given to the said Bemoym, but was
              always to belong to the king</a
            >. For this purpose a great quantity of stones and planed timber was
            then prepared, and also priests were assembled and a great number of
            articles for churches and for the business of conversion; and Master
            Alvaro, preacher to the king, of the order of Sam Domingos, was
            selected to be the principal person.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]"
              >One of the very chief reasons which inspired the king to prepare
              this fleet, and especially to undertake the building of a fortress
              at the entrance of this river, was his conviction that the said
              river, penetrating far into the interior, flowed to the city of
              Tambucutu [Timbuktu] and by Mombare, where are the richest trades
              and markets of gold in the world, from which all Berberia from
              east and west up to Jherusalem is supplied and provided.</a
            >
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]"
              >For he believed that the said fortress in order to free and
              safeguard the trade would provide great security in such a place
              for his men and the merchandise.</a
            >
            This region up to the river and a little beyond was discovered in
            the time and by the command of the Infante Dom Anrique, the inventor
            and discoverer of this enterprise and the conquest of Guinee; and in
            his letters and records it appears that he called this river the
            <a>Nillo</a>, not that which enters the Mar do Levante at
            Alexandria, but another branch of it which the cosmographers say
            runs out to this ocean sea. But the real truth of this up to now –
            which is the time of our lord King Dom Manuel the First – has yet to
            be learned. Nevertheless, all these works, expenses and plans of
            Bemoym were <a>changed</a> to deeds of evil; because, after the said
            Pero Vaaz had put to land and entered into the said river, by
            readily believing suspicions of disloyalty and treason against
            Bemoym, or more truthfully because he wanted to return to the
            kingdom, he slew the said Bemoym with a sword, and then returned to
            this kingdom; whereat the king, being in Tavilla, grew very sad; and
            he overlooked this crime by Pero Vaaz, seeing that he did not visit
            <a>heavy punishment</a> upon him or many others who served it for
            the same reason; yet the king strongly disapproved of their killing
            him, since, being accomplices in such an error, they ought to have
            been treated as they treated him, because they had him freely in
            their power without offence or peril.

Rui (or Ruy) de Pina was a native of Guarda. He acted as secretary of the embassy sent by King John II of Portugal to Castile in the spring of 1482, and in the following September returned there as sole envoy. He was present at the execution of Fernando II, Duke of Braganza at Évora in 1483, and in 1484 went to Rome as secretary of an embassy to Pope Innocent VIII. Upon his return, the king charged him to write a history of his reign and gave him a pension for his support. <br><br>Following the return of Christopher Columbus from his first voyage in 1493, Pina was one of the commissaries dispatched to Barcelona by John II to negotiate with the Catholic sovereigns respecting the limits of their respective jurisdictions, that would culminate in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. In September 1495 he attested the will of John II in his capacity as a notary public, and on 25 October of the same year he was present at his master’s death at Alvor and opened and read his testament. <br><br>The new king, Manuel I, confirmed his pension and in 1497 appointed him high chronicler (cronista-mor) of the kingdom, keeper of the archives of Torre do Tombo and royal librarian, with a suitable salary. By 1504 Rui de Pina had completed his chronicles of Afonso V and John II. In 1521, King John III charged him with a history of his father, Manuel, and at his death Pina had carried it down to the capture of Azamor, as we know from Damião de Góis, who used it in preparing his own chronicle of that monarch.

He is known for re-establishing the power of the Portuguese monarchy, reinvigorating the Portuguese economy, and renewing his country’s exploration of Africa and the Orient.<br><br>John II famously restored the policies of Atlantic exploration, reviving the work of his great-uncle, Henry the Navigator. The Portuguese explorations were his main priority in government. Portuguese explorers pushed south along the known coast of Africa with the purpose of discovering the maritime route to India and breaking into the spice trade. During his reign, the following achievements were realized: <blockquote>- 1482 – Foundation of the coastal fortress and trade post of São Jorge da Mina <br>- 1484 – Discovery of the Congo River by Diogo Cão.<br>- 1488 – Discovery and passage of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu Dias in Mossel Bay.<br>- 1493 – Start of the settlement of the São Tomé and Príncipe islands by Álvaro Caminha.<br>- Funding of land expeditions by Afonso de Paiva and Pêro da Covilhã to India and Ethiopia in search of the kingdom of Prester John.</blockquote>The true extent of Portuguese explorations has been the subject of academic debate. According to one theory, some navigations were kept secret for fear of competition by neighbouring Castile. The archives of this period were mainly destroyed in the fire after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and what was not destroyed during the earthquake was either stolen or destroyed during the Peninsular War or otherwise lost.
