          <p>
            Proceeding further in a word, he said that, if perhaps in reply to
            his petition for justice and help men should deny that he was a
            Christian, even as upon other occasions word had been sent to him by
            way of an excuse for refusing another similar request, there should
            now be no doubt or contradiction about it, because he and all his
            men who are present, among whom there were not wanting men of noble
            and royal birth, advised at other times by His holy warnings, had
            come in order that in his kingdoms and at his hands they might at
            once become Christians. He <a>said that</a> the only sorrow and
            truly great anxiety, which they had thereby experienced, arose out
            of the fact that it seemed that the force of his necessity rather
            than of his faith had caused him to do it. With these he coupled
            many other sound reasons touching his purpose. Then the king replied
            to him in a few words, and devoted great care and much wisdom to
            everything, expressing great pleasure at their meeting and even more
            pleasure at his final intention to be a Christian. Therefore he gave
            him hope in this world of assistance in his cause and of restoration
            to his kingdom and another that of glory and eternal salvation.
            Thereupon, he dismissed him, and Bemoym went to speak to the queen
            and to the prince, before whom he made a short speech, in which with
            shrewd judgment and very natural dignity he asked them for a favor
            and assistance with the King. The queen and the prince dismissed
            him, <a>shewing</a> him much honour and kindness. Then, on another
            day, Bemoym came to speak with the king, and, alone and apart, with
            an interpreter, they both conversed for a long time. Here Bemoym
            again recounted his affairs with great prudence; and he also replied
            very wisely and exactly to the questions which the king asked him,
            and the king remained very satisfied with this. In his honour the
            king ordered both fights and tournaments, and he held fancy
            dress-balls and dances, and in order that he might see them he gave
            orders for a chair to be placed at the upper end of the state room
            opposite the king. Moreover, it was the kingâ€™s wish that Bemoym
            before becoming a Christian, should first be instructed in matters
            of the faith; for Bemoym was of the sect of Malamede [Muhammad] in
            whom he believed, because of his being a neighbour of, and dealer
            with, the Azanegues, and he had some knowledge of the contents of
            the Bible. For these reasons, theologians and learned men conversed
            with him and taught and advised him. Then it was decided that he
            should see and listen to a mass for the king, and this mass was said
            in pontifical and with great formality and ceremonial in the church
            of Santa Maria de Todoslos Santos. Bemoym with his men and with
            learned Christians was in the choir, and, at the elevation of the
            body of Our Lord, when he saw all on their knees with their hands
            raised in the act of prayer, his hand went up to the cap which he
            had on his head; and thus, like everybody, with his knees on the
            ground and his head uncovered, he prayed. Then he said with many
            indications of truth that the remorse, which he experienced in his
            heart in that hour, he took as clear proof that this was the only
            true God of salvation. Then for two days the king proceeded to
            banquet publicly, for which purpose he put on his robes and he
            commanded that the house and the table were to be furnished with
            plate and tapestries, dishes and service, and there were to be
            minstrels and dances, and all in great perfection; for the king was
            deliberately very particular and exact about ceremonial above all in
            matters touching his estate. At the second hour of the night of the
            third day of the month of November, the said Bemoym, and six of the
            principal persons who had come with him, became Christians in the
            chamber of the queen, which was decorated for the occasion with
            elaborate formality.
