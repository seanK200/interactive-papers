            Antoine Barnave, “Speech to the National Assembly” (1790), From Lynn Hunt, ed., and trans., The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief Documentary History (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 1996), 109-111, part of the document is an original translation by David Kammerling Smith from Archives parlementaires (Paris) 12 (1881): 68-70, reprinted in Richard Lim and David Kammerling Smith, eds., The West in the Wider World (New York: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003), 147-150.
          </h3>

            <b>Sirs, the commerce [the merchant community] of France has made known to you its wishes and its worries on several objects in which it is interested, and particularly on the various relations between France and her colonies. 
              At the same time that these petitions [from French merchants] were addressed to you, news arrived from Saint Domingue and Martinique that held all of your attention. You sensed the necessity of taking, with regard to the <a>colonies</a>, a wise and prompt resolution. And perceiving an intimate connection between the causes of their [the two colonies’] agitation and the requests of commerce, you named a committee to investigate these together and present to you an outcome proper to reconcile the various interests. 
              In discerning, Sirs, the goals of our mission, we soon recognized that all the questions that are presented reduce themselves, at the present moment, to extremely simple terms. 
              The interest of the French nation to support its commerce, to preserve its colonies, and to favor their prosperity by every means compatible with the interests of the metropole [homeland], appeared to us, by every point of view, as an incontestable truth. 
              The measures to take, in order to achieve this, appeared to us not less clearly indicated by the principles and by the circumstances. 
              Reassure the colonies on their mot dear interests, receive from the instructions on the system of government which is convenient to their prosperity and that it is finally time to establish; invite them to present their views, concurrently with French commerce, on their reciprocal relations: such is the procedure that the circumstances, justice, and reason have appeared to prescribe to us. . . . It is not a question, in fact, of examining if France should seek to establish a commerce or to found some colonies. These things already exist. At the moment in which we are speaking, all the aspects of our social existence are intimately linked and merged with the existence of large-scale trade with our colonies. Thus, it is only a question of knowing if the suppression, if the sudden loss of these immense resources would not produce a violent and destructive jolt, would not be a great disaster for the nation? 
              It is a question of knowing above all if, in our present situation, engaged in a revolution of which the completion assures forever the glory and prosperity of the French nation and of which the failure will plunge the French nation into an unfathomable evil, this violent jolt would not present the most formidable stumbling block; if the situation of our finances would not suffer from this a blow without remedy; if the force of the malcontents would not increase from this beyond all proportion; if, finally, the constitution, which alone would be able with time to repair these great calamities, would not be itself overthrown by this. When one is willing to consider the question from these points of view, the question no longer will present any doubts; one will appreciate that it is necessary above all, to prevent the evils that most closely menace us, and that all other speculations become foreign when it is a question of the sacred interest of the Revolution and of the destiny of the several million Frenchmen who are attached to the prosperity of our commerce, to the possession of our colonies.
