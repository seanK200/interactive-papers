          <p>
            Very high and very powerful prince King of Portugal, our brother,
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir, your highness has been so good as to promise us that anything
            we need we should ask for in our letters, and that everything will
            be provided. And so that there may be peace and health of our
            kingdoms, by God’s will, in our lifetime. And as there are among us
            old folks and people who have lived for many days, many and
            different diseases happen so often that we are pushed to the
            ultimate extremes. And the same happens to our children, relatives,
            and people, because this country lacks physicians and surgeons who
            might know the proper cures for such diseases, as well as pharmacies
            and drugs to make them better. And for this reason many of those who
            had been already confirmed and instructed in the things of the holy
            faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ perish and die. And the rest of the
            people for the most part cure themselves with herbs and sticks and
            other ancient methods, so that they live putting all their faith in
            these herbs and ceremonies, and die believing that they are saved;
            and this serves God poorly.
          </p>

              since it is from God and from your highness that all the good and
              the drugs and medicines have come to us for our salvation, we ask
              your merciful highness to send us two physicians and two
              pharmacists and one surgeon, so that they may come with their
              pharmacies and necessary things to be in our kingdoms, for we have
              extreme need of each and every one of them.</a
            >
            We will be very good and merciful to them, since sent by your
            highness, their work and coming should be for good. We ask your
            highness as a great favor to do this for us, because besides being
            good in itself it is in the service of God as we have said above.
