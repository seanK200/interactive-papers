              >The town of Kilwa lies on an island around which ships of 500
              tons can sail.</a
            >
            The island and town have a population of 4,000 people. It is very
            fertile and produces maize similar to that of Guinea, butter, honey,
            and wax. On the trees hang beehives like jars of three almudes
            capacity, each closed with woven palm leaves. There are holes
            through which the bees go in and come out.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many trees and palms here and <a>on the mainland</a>, some
            of them different from those of Portugal. From the island to the
            mainland the distance is in some places two leagues and in others
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are sweet oranges, lemons, vegetables, small onions, and
            aromatic herbs. They are grown in gardens and watered with water
            from the wells. Here also grows betel which has leaves like ivy and
            is grown like peas with sticks at the root for support. The leaf is
            used by the wealthy Arabs for chewing together with specially
            prepared limes which look like an ointment. They keep the leaves as
            if they were to be put on wounds. These leaves make the mouth and
            teeth very red, but are said to be most refreshing.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are more black slaves than white Moors here: they are engaged
            on farms growing maize and other things. There are various types of
            peas which are produced by plants as high as large pepper trees;
            when they are ripe, they are gathered and stored. The soil is red,
            the top layer being sandy; the grass is always green. There are many
            fat beasts, oxen, cows, sheep, and goats and also plenty of fish;
            there are also whales which swim round the ships. There is no
            running drinking water on the island. Near the island there are
            other small islands which are inhabited. There are many boats as
            large as a caravel of fifty tons and other smaller ones. The large
            ones lie aground on the shore and are dragged down to the sea when
            the people wish to sail them. They are built without nails: the
            planks are sewn together with rope made from knotted coir from the
            coconut palm. The same kind of rope is used for the rudder. The
            boats are caulked with black pitch made from crude incense and
            resin. They sail from here to Sofala, 255 leagues away.
          </p>
          <p>
            The palms here do not produce dates but from some of them wine and
            vinegar are obtained. These come from the palm trees which do not
            produce coconuts. The coconuts are the size of large melons, and
            from the fibres inside the shell all kinds of rope are made. Inside
            the shell is a fruit the size of a large pineapple. It contains half
            a pint of milk which is very pleasant to drink. When the milk has
            been drunk the nut is broken and eaten; the kernel tastes like a
            walnut which is not fully ripe. They dry it and it yields a large
            quantity of oil.
