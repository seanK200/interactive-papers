          <p>
            Man, when he enters the world, is naturally led to enquire who he
            is; whence he comes; whither he is going; for what purpose he is
            created; and by whose benevolence he is preserved. He finds himself
            descended from the <a>remotest creation</a>; journeying to
            <a>a life of perfection and happiness</a>, and led by his endowments
            to a contemplation of the works of nature.
            <br />
            <br / > Like other animals who enjoy life, sensation, and
            perception, seek for food, amusements, and rest, and who prepare
            habitations convenient for their kind, he is curious and
            inquisitive; but, above all other animals, he is noble in his
            nature, in as much as, by the powers of his mind, he is able to
            reason justly upon whatever discovers itself to his senses; and to
            look, with reverence and wonder, upon the works of Him who created
            all things.
            <br />
            <br />
            That existence is purely contemptible, which regards only the
            Ratification of infinitive wants, and the preservation of a body
            made to perish. It is therefore the business of a thinking being, to
            look forward to the purposes of all things; and to remember that the
            end of creation is, that God may be glorified in all his works.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hence it is of importance that we should study the works of nature,
            than which, what could be more useful, what more interesting? For,
            however large a portion of them lies open to our present view, a
            still greater part is yet unknown and undiscovered.
            <br />
            <br />
            All things are not within the immediate reach of human capacity.
            Many have been made known to us, of which those who went before were
            ignorant; many we have heard of, but know not what they are; and
            many must remain for the diligence of future ages.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is the exclusive property of man, to contemplate and to reason on
            the
            <a>great book of nature</a>. She gradually unfolds herself to him
            who, with patience and perseverance, will search into her mysteries;
            and when the memory of the present and of past generations shall be
            entirely obliterated he shall enjoy the high privilege of living in
            the minds of his successors, as he has been advanced in the dignity
            of his nature, by the labours of those who went before him.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Universe comprehends whatever exists; whatever can come to our
            knowledge by the agency of our senses. The Stars, the Elements, and
            this our Globe.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Stars are bodies remote, lucid, revolving in perpetual motion.
            They shine either by their own proper light, as the Sun, and the
            remoter fixed Stars; or are Planets receiving light from stars. Of
            these the primary planets are solar: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars; the
            Earth, Venus, Mercury, and Georgium Sidus; the secondary are those
            subservient to, and rolling around the primary, as the Moon around
            the earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Elements are simple bodies constituting the atmosphere and
            probably filling the spaces between the stars.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fire: lucid, resilient, warm, evolant, vivifying.
            <br />
            <br />Air: transparent, elastic, dry, encirculating, generating.
            <br />
            <br />
            Water: diaphanous, fluid, moist, gliding, conceiving.
            <br />
            <br />
            Earth: opaque, fixed, cold, quiescent, sterile.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Earth is a planetary sphere, turning around its own axis, once
            in 24 hours, and around the sun once a year; surrounded by an
            atmosphere of elements, and covered by a stupendous crust of natural
            bodies, which are the object of our studies. It is terraqueous
            having the depressed parts covered with waters, the elevated parts
            gradually dilated into dry and habitable continents. The land is
            moistened by vapours, which rising from the waters, are collected
            into clouds; these are deposited upon the tops of mountains; form
            small streams, which unite into rivulets, and reunite into these
            ever-flowing rivers, which pervading the thirsty earth, and
            affording moisture to the productions growing for the support of her
            living inhabitants are at last returned into their parent sea.
