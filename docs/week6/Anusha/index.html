          <p>
            America is not less singular for the uniformity in the figure and
            <a>colour of its inhabitants</a>, than Africa is remarkable for the
            variety of men it contains. This part of the world is very ancient,
            and very populous. The climate is extremely hot; and yet the
            temperature of the air differs widely in different nations. Their
            manners also are not less various, as appears from the description I
            have given of them. All these causes have concurred in producing a
            greater variety of men in this quarter of the globe than in any
            other; for in examining the differences of temperature in the
            countries of Africa, we find, that in Barbary and all the regions
            adjacent to the Mediterranean, the men are white, and only a little
            tawny; this whole tract of country is refreshed, on one hand, by the
            air of the Mediterranean Sea, and by the snows on Mount Atlas, on
            the other; it is, besides, situated in the Temperate zone. on this
            side of the Tropic. All the natives, likewise, from Egypt to the
            Canary islands, are only more or less tawny. Beyond the Tropic, and
            on the other side of Mount Atlas, the heat becomes much greater, and
            the inhabitants are very brown, but not entirely black. When we
            come, however, to the 17th or 18th degree of north latitude, under
            which Senegal and Nubia are situated, the heat is excessive, and the
            natives are perfectly black. At Senegal the liquor in the
            thermometer rises to 38 degrees, while it seldom rises to 30 in
            France, and never exceeds 25 in Peru, though it be situated under
            the Torrid Zone. In Nubia we have no observations made with the
            thermometer; but all travellers agree in declaring the heat to be
            excessive. The sandy deserts between Upper Egypt and Nubia heat the
            air to such a degree that the north wind must be extremely scorching
            in that country. Besides, as the east wind, which generally blows
            between the Tropics, arrives not at Nubia till it has traversed
            Arabia, it is not surprising to find the natives very black; it is
            less surprising to see the inhabitants of Senegal perfectly black;
            for the east wind before it reaches them, must blow over the whole
            of Africa in its great breadth, which renders the heat of the air
            almost insupportable. Taking, therefore, the whole of Africa
            situated between the Tropics, where the east wind blows most
            constantly, we may easily conceive why the western coasts of this
            pan of the globe should and actually do suffer a greater degree of
            heat than the eastern coasts; for this wind arrives at the eastern
            coasts with a freshness which it acquires by traversing a vast sea;
            but, on the other hand, before it arrives at the western coasts it
            acquires a scorching heat by blowing across the interior regions of
            Africa. It is for this reason that the coasts of Senegal, Sierra,
            Sierra-Leona, Guiana, and all the western parts of Africa situated
            under the Tropics, are the hottest climates on the globe. It is not
            near so hot on the eastern coasts as at Mozambique, Mombaza, etc. I
            cannot. therefore, hesitate in ascribing to this reason the cause of
            our finding true Negroes, or the blackest men on the western
            territories of Africa, and Caffres, or men of a less deep blackness
            on the eastern coasts. The difference between these two kinds of
            blacks, which is very apparent, proceeds from the heat of the
            climate, which is not very hot in the eastern parts, but excessive
            on the western. Beyond the Tropic on the south, the heat
            considerably diminishes, both on account of the higher latitude, and
            because the point of Africa begins to turn narrow; and this point of
            land, being surrounded by the sea, receives fresher breezes than if
            it had been in the midst of a continent. The natives also of this
            country begin to whiten, and are naturally more white than black, as
            was formerly remarked. Nothing can prove more clearly that the
            climate is the principal cause of the varieties of mankind, than
            this colour of the Hottentots, whose blackness could not be
            diminished but by the temperature of the climate.

            We will be the more confirmed in this opinion, if we examine the
            other people who live under the Tropics to the east of Africa. The
            inhabitants of the Maldiva islands, of Ceylon, of the point of the
            Indian Peninsula, of Sumatra, of Malacca, of Borneo, of Celebes, of
            the Philippine islands, etc. are all very brown, without being
            absolutely black; because all these territories are either islands
            or peninsulas. The sea in these climates has a great effect in
            tempering the air; and besides, the east and west winds, which blow
            alternately in this part of the globe, pass over a vast extent of
            sea, before they arrive at this Archipelago. Thus all these islands
            are peopled with brown men, <a>because</a> the heat is not
            excessive. But in New Guinea we find blacks, who, from the
            descriptions of voyagers, appear to be <a>real Negroes</a>; because,
            in this country, which extends far to the east as to form a kind of
            continent, the wind which traverses it is much hotter than that
            which prevails in the Indian ocean. In New Holland, which is not so
            hot a climate, the natives are less black, and very similar to the
            Hottentots. Do not these Negroes and Hottentots, who live so remote
            from the other people distinguished by that appellation, prove that
            their colour depends on the heat of the climate? No communication
            can ever be supposed to have taken place between Africa and this
            southern continent; and yet we find there the same species of men,
            because the same circumstances concur in producing the same degree
            of heat. An example taken from the other animals will still farther
            confirm what has been advanced. It has been remarked, that, in the
            province of Dauphiny, all the swine are black, but that in Vivarais,
            on the other side of all Rhone, where it is colder than in Dauphiny,
            all these animals are white. It is not probable that the inhabitants
            of one of these two provinces would agree to raise only black swine,
            and the other only white swine. It appears to me, that this
            phenomenon is owing to the different temperature of the climates,
            combined perhaps with the manner of feeding these animals.
