            M. Le Romain, “Negre,” from the Encyclopedie (1751-1772); from
            Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ed., Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader
            (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2007), 91-93

          <p>
            “Negre”
          </p>
          <p>
            Man who inhabits different parts of the earth, from the Tropic of
            Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Africa has no other inhabitants
            but the blacks. Not only the color, but also the facial traits
            distinguish them from other men: large and flat noses, thick lips,
            and wool instead of hair. They appear to constitute a new species of
            mankind.

            If one moves further away from the Equator toward the Antarctic, the
            black skin becomes lighter, but the <a>ugliness remains</a>: one
            finds there this same wicked people that inhabits the African
            Meridian. If one goes east, the features soften and become more
            regular, but the skin color remains black as inside Africa. After
            these [eastern peoples], one encounters a greatly tanned people,
            distinguishable from others by their narrow and obliquely positioned
            long eyes. If we pass through this vast part of the world which
            appears to be separate from Europe, from Africa and Asia, one finds
            – if several travelers are to be believed – a different human
            variety. There is absolutely no white person: the land is peopled by
            red nations tanned in a thousand ways…

            Many physicians have researched the causes of the blackness of the
            negro. The major opinions that the physicians hold on this manner
            can be reduced to two:
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="attributes">
              one attributes the cause to bile, the other to some fluid
              contained in the veins of the mucous membrane.
            </a>
            Malpighi, Ruysch, Littre, Santorini, Heiftner, and Albinus have done
            intriguing researches on the skin of the negroes. The first opinion
            on the blackness of the negro is entirely supported by proofs in a
            work entitled Dissertation sur la cause physique de la couleur des
            negres, etc. by M. Barrere (Paris, 1741). The following is how he
            deduced his hypothesis: when after a long maceration of the black
            skin in water, the outer skin is removed an attentively examined,
            one finds that it is black, very thin, and
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="attributes2"
              >transparent when held up to daylight.</a

            That is how I saw it in America, and it has been remarked upon as
            well by the anatomists of our time, such as M. Winslow… It would be,
            in fact, the fruit of a great ignorance, or of a strange evil faith,
            to claim to separate the prosperity of national commerce from the
            possessions of our colonies.
