            <h5>James Beattie, “A Response to Hume” (1770), General and Particular
            (multivolume work published between 1748-1808); from Emmanuel
            Chukwudi Eze, ed., Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader (Malden, MA:
            Blackwell, 2007), 36-37</h5>
          </p>
          … they have none, because they have no letters, but in oratory, some
          of them, particularly the Indians of the Five Nations, are said to be
          greatly our superiors. It will be readily allowed that the condition
          of a slave is not favourable to genius of any kind; and yet, the
          negro-slaves dispersed over <a>Europe</a>, have often discovered symptoms of
          ingenuity, notwithstanding their unhappy circumstances. They become
          excellent handicraftsmen, and practical musicians, and indeed learn
          everything their masters are at pains to teach them, perfidy and
          debauchery not excepted. That a negro-slave, who can neither read nor
          write, nor speak any European language, who is not permitted to do
          anything but what his master commands, and who has not a friend on
          earth, but is universally considered and treated as if he were of a
          species inferior to the human - that such a creature should so
          distinguish himself among Europeans, as to be talked of throughout the
          world for a man of genius, i <a>s surely no reasonable expectation</a>. To
          suppose him of an inferior species, because he does not thus
          distinguish himself, is just as rational as to suppose any private
          European of an inferior species, because he has not raised himself to
          the condition of royalty. Had the Europeans been <a>destitute of the arts</a>
          of writing and working in iron, they might have remained to this day
          <a>as barbarous as the natives of Africa and America</a>. Nor is the
          invention of these arts to be ascribed to our superior capacity. The
          genius of the inventor is not always to be estimated according to the
          <a>importance of the invention</a>. Gunpowder and the mariner's compass have
          produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs, and yet were
          accidental discoveries. Such, probably, were the first essays in
          writing and working with iron. Suppose them the effects of
          contrivance: they were at least contrived by a few individuals, and if
          they required a superiority of understanding, or of species, in the
          inventors, those inventors, and their descendants, are the only people
          who can lay claim to the <a>honour</a> of that superiority.
