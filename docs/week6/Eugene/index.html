            The few blacks who are found in the Philippines, and some other
            islands of the Indian ocean, are probably derived from the Papous or
            Negroes of New Guinea, with which the Europeans have been acquainted
            for these last 50 years only. Dampier, in the year 1700, discovered
            the most eastern parts of this country, to which he gave the name of
            New Britain; but its extent is still unknown; we only know that
            those parts of it which have been discovered seem to be thinly
            inhabited.

            Thus it appears that
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Q1"
              >the existence of Negroes is confined to those parts of the earth
              where all the necessary circumstances concur in producing a
              constant and an excessive heat</a
            >. This heat is so necessary, not only to the production, but even
            to the preservation of Negroes, that it has been remarked in our
            islands, where the heat, though great, is not comparable to that of
            Senegal, that the Negro infants are so liable to be affected by
            impressions from the air, that the proprietors are obliged to keep
            them, for the first nine days after birth, in dose warm chambers. If
            these precautions be neglected, and the children exposed to the air
            immediately after birth, they are liable to be affected with a
            tetanus or locked jaw, which proves fatal, because it deprives them
            of the power of taking nourishment. M. Littre, who dissected a Negro
            in the year 1702, remarked, that the end of the glans, which was not
            covered with the prepuce, was black, and that the part of it which
            was covered was perfectly white. This observation demonstrates that
            the air is necessary to produce the blackness of Negroes. Their
            children are born white, or rather red, like those of other men. But
            two or three days after their colour changes to a yellowish tawny,
            which grows gradually darker till the seventh or eighth day, when
            they are totally black. It is well known, that all children, two or
            three days after birth, are affected with a kid of <a>jaundice</a>,
            which among white people soon passes off and leaves no impression;
            but in Negroes, on the contrary, it gives an indelible colour to the
            skin, which becomes always more and more black. M. Kolbe remarks,
            that he has seen Hottentot children, who were born as white as the
            Europeans, become olive in consequence of this jaundice, and the
            impressions of the air, however, are only the occasional, and not
            the primary causes of blackness; for it has been observed, that the
            children of Negroes, as soon as they come into the world, have black
            genitals, and a black spot at the root of their nails. The action of
            the air and the jaundice may perhaps help to expand this colour; but
            it is certain, that the rudiments of blackness are communicated to
            them by their parents; that, in whatever part of the world a Negro
            is brought forth, he will be equally black as if he had been born in
            his own country; and that if there is any difference in the first
            generation, it is so small as not to be perceptible. This fact,
            however, implies not that the colour will continue the same after
            many successive generations. On the contrary, there are many reasons
            for presuming, that as this colour is originally the effect of a
            long continued heat, it will be gradually effaced by the temperature
            of a cold climate; and, consequently, that if a colony of Negroes
            were transplanted into a northern province, their descendants of the
            eighth, tenth, or twelth generation would be much fairer, and
            perhaps as white as the natives of that climate.

            Anatomists have inquired into the seat of this black colour. Some of
            them allege, that it neither resides in the skin nor scarf-skin, but
            in the cellular membrane between them; that this membrane, after
            long maceration in hot water, retains its original blackness; but
            that the skin and scarf-skin appear to be as white as those of other
            men. Dr Town, and some others have maintained, that the blood of the
            Negroes is black, and that their blackness originates entirely from
            their blood. I am much inclined to believe this fact; for I have
            observed, that among us the blood of those persons who have tawny,
            yellowish, or brown complexions, is blacker than that of those who
            are fairer. M. Barrere, who seems to have examined this subject most
            minutely, tells us, and Mr Winslow agrees with him, that the
            scarf-skin of Negroes is black; and though its extreme thinness and
            transparency may make it appear white, that it is really as bla k as
            the blackest horn, when reduced to the same degree of thinness. They
            also assure us, that the skin of Negroes is of a reddish brown
            colour, approaching to black. This colour of the Negroes, according
            to Barrere, is produced by their bile, which he affirms, from
            several dissections he made in Cayenne, instead of yellow, to be as
            black as ink. The bile, when absorbed and dispersed through the
            body, tinges the skin of white people yellow; and if it were black,
            it would probably produce a black colour. But as soon as the
            effusion of the bile ceases, the skin resumes its natural whiteness.
            We must therefore suppose that the bile of the Negroes is
            perpetually effused, or as Barrere alleges, that it is so abundant
            as to be naturally secreted in the scarf-skin, and to tinge it of a
            black colour. Upon the whole it is probable, that both the bile and
            blood of Negroes are browner than those of white people, as their
            skin is likewise blacker. But one of these facts cannot be admitted
            to prove the cause of the other; for if the blackness of the blood
            or bile be allowed to give the same colour to the skin, then instead
            of demanding why the skin of Negroes is black, we ought to ask why
            their blood or their bile is of that colour? This species of false
            reasoning, in place of solving the question, renders it still more
            intricate. To me it has always appeared, that the same cause which
            makes our complexions brown, after being exposed to the action of
            the air, and to the rays of the sun, which renders the Spaniards
            more brown than the French, and the Moors than the Spaniards, also
            renders the Negroes blacker than the Moors. Besides, I am not here
            inquiring how this cause acts;
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Q2">
              I only mean to ascertain that it does act, and that its effects
              are more perceptible in proportion to its strength and time of
              acting.</a
