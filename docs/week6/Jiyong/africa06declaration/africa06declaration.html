          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The representatives of the French people, organized as a National
              Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect or contempt of the
              rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the
              corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a
              solemn declaration the natural, inalienable, and sacred rights of
              man, in order that this declaration, being constantly before
              <a data-ip-footnote-id="[M]">
                all the members of the social body </a
              >, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in
              order that the acts of the legislative power, as well as those of
              the executive power, may be compared at any moment with the
              objects and purposes of all political institutions and may thus be
              more respected; and, lastly, in order that the grievances of the
              citizens, based hereafter upon simple and incontestable
              principles, shall tend to the maintenance of the constitution and
              redound to the happiness of all. Therefore the National Assembly
              recognizes and proclaims, in the presence and under the auspices
              of the Supreme Being, the following rights of man and of the
              citizen:
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Article 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social
            distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the
            natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty,
            property, security, and resistance of oppression.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the
            nation.<a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]">
              No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not
              proceed directly from the nation.</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no
            one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has
            no limits except those which assure to the other members of the
            society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be
            determined by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society.
            Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one
            may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a
            right to participate personally, or through his representative, in
            its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or
            punishes. <a data-ip-footnote-id="[4]">All citizens</a>, being equal
            in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to
            all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities,
            and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents.
          </p>

          <p>
            7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the
            cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one
            soliciting, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed, any
            arbitrary order, shall be punished. But any citizen summoned or
            arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without delay, as
            resistance constitutes an offense.
          </p>

          <p>
            8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly
            and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except
            it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated
            before the commission of the offense.
          </p>

          <p>
            9. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been
            declared guilty, if arrest be deemed indispensable, all harshness
            not essential to the securing of the prisoner’s person shall be
            severly repressed by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including
            his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb
            the public order established by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most
            precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly,
            speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for
            such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires
            public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for
            the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom
            they shall be intrusted.
          </p>

          <p>
            13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the
            public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be
            equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their
            means.
          </p>

          <p>
            14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by
            their representatives, as to the necessity of the public
            contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put;
            and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection
            and the duration of the taxes.
          </p>

          15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account
          of his administrations. 16. A society in which the observance of the
          law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no
          constitution at all. 17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred
          right, no one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity,
          legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on
          condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably
          indemnified.

          <div class="footnote" id="[10]">
            What are the unalienable rights of man (Articles 1-17)? What is the purpose of establishing these rights to the people and how does it affect the relationship between those who govern and those who are governed (paragraph 1)? What is revolutionary about this text is that it establishes a precedent of governance whereby people have certain rights afforded to them, so that the government cannot rule with wanton abandon. It reflects the Enlightenment ideals of social critique; how society needs to curtail the power of political authority in pursuance of intellectual liberty. Individuals should only obey a political authority if that authority respects the “rights” of the people (Articles 14-15).
          </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="[11]">
            The rights of man is written in the format of a list, which outlines the “natural, inalienable and sacred rights of man” (p1, ⁋1) First the document explains that they will list the rights of man as representatives of the French People as well as the rights and duties of the leaders. Throughout the text there is the repetition of words such as “all”, “same”, “every”, and “equal”. This repetition emphasizes their idea that “All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities…” (p2, ⁋7) The text is written in a tone which is very authoritative in the sense that it presents these rights as a given. In the very title of “Declaration if the Rights of Man” the word declaration forms this idea since a declaration is an announcement and announcements are generally not up for debate, but already established. Adding to this tone the text also does not seem to give much explanation as to why these are all rights. It uses phrases such as “happiness of all” (pg2, ⁋1), and “general good” (p2, ⁋2) to explain the goal of these right but are very vague. This text reflects Enlightenment ideas in how it tries to create universal guidelines, which is an example of how people during this time were searching for universal ideas. It is also connected since it was written with the idea of accomplishing one of the main goals of this movement which is “happiness”. It can be seen as revolutionary in the sense that the French came together and their representatives (National Assembly) were taking action and declaring what they deserve and expect from their nation. These people were no longer simply obeying what they were told, but rather using their own reasoning and understanding to create the list of their rights.
          </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="[12]">
            Olympe de Gouges’ “Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen” is a document written in direct response to the “Declaration of the Rights of Man” written by the French National Assembly two years prior. Keeping this in mind, the context of the document becomes abundantly clear. The revolution in France is in full swing and as representatives of the people, men declared their inalienable rights and separated themselves from the monarchy. This does not sit with de Gouge because the written articles only mention men. As a result she rewrites many of the original articles replacing ‘man’ with ‘women’ while perpetuating and asserting the idea that men and women are equal. For example, Article 17 of the “Declaration of Rights of Man” states, “Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably indemnified.” Meanwhile the first article of the “Declaration of Rights of Woman” states, “Property belongs to both sexes whether united or separate; for each it is an inviolable and sacred right; no one can be deprived of it, since it is the true patrimony of nature, unless the legally determined public need obviously dictates it, and then only with a just and prior indemnity”(4). In writing her declaration, de Gouge asserts that women can and should participate in the enlightening aspect of the French Revolution. What is so revolutionary about this is that de Gouge is a woman championing women’s rights in time where this was unheard of. Women had not been able to break into specific social, political, and cultural spheres in this time period. Additionally, women during the American Revolution were also able to attain similar rights that the men declared they had.
          </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="[13]">
            The most significant part that is missing from the “Declaration of the Rights of Man” is addressing the people of different race, ethnicity, and skin color. The passage seems to be stating all the rights of men, and it never talks about different ethnicities and skin colors. Even though we are in the enlightenment period and we can see the significant changes (such as new knowledge and more people knowing how to exercise their rights), white men and men of color are still not same. During 1789, there were still slaves. Slaves did not have the same rights and freedom as stated in the declaration; the colored slaves were below the white men. Therefore, the passage should add an Article clarifying whom the declaration includes. For example, when the passage states “men are born and remain free and equal in rights”[1] This probably does not include the slaves, knowing that slaves were still mistreated in 1789. If this is the case, the text should add somewhere in the text the types of people the declaration is including, so it doesn’t cause misunderstandings. In the end, as shown from the “Declaration of the Rights of Men,” the ideas and amount of knowledge the ordinary people know are flourishing. In the past, the public relied on the elites to tell their rights, but now it has changed (enlightenment period) Although it has changed, they are still far away from where we are today.  [1] “Declaration of the Rights of Men” (August 26, 1789)
          </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="[14]">
            In the Declaration of the Rights of Man, with a focus on page one of the document, there are many surprising elements. The first is that the text is proclaiming rights solely for men, excluding women from this document’s benefits. While this element is more tragic than anything as it is a representation of extreme gender inequality in these ancient times, it is still a surprising aspect. Another shocking element is how there is specification that these rights are given to men who are citizens and not just men as a whole. This leads ones identity and worth in society during this time to be tied to their citizenship as well as their gender. Furthermore, the text makes the claim that “No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views” (Declaration of the Rights of Man). This is peculiar as it is quite a jump from the approach of many ancient empires and dynasties we have studied. In previous times, it was not uncommon to use forced conversion and take a proselytizing approach to the concept of religion within a state; this completely overrules that approach. Lastly, another line in the text states, “Many rights involve obedience to societal norms, yet document introduction is directed towards exclusively men with citizenship” (Declaration of the Rights of Man). I found this to be particularly interesting because in a document where in addition to proclamation of rights there are calls to legal and social order, one would logically assume that this applies to all members of society, but with the text’s exclusive nature that does not appear to be the case. One strong aspect I found to be revolutionary in this piece was that the document’s creation is rooted in representatives that were organized on the basis of “believing that the ignorance, neglect or contempt of the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and…corruption of governments” (Declaration of the Rights of Man). This is a revolutionary and important way of beginning a long-lasting manner of criticizing governmental flaws. The revolutionary nature of the text is furthered in its lack of explicit racial distinctions. Racial specifications in texts during this time were not uncommon, as seen in Kant’s “On the Different Races of Man” written only fourteen years prior to the Declaration of the Rights of Man, yet this text contains none. Though there is definitely language used to separate people based on gender and citizenship, it is worth noting that the use of “men” when referencing who would receive these rights without specifying the race of said men is quite revolutionary. Lastly, the document presents a balance between recognizing all-powerful position of law, government representatives, and the state as a whole over its people while guaranteeing this power will not be abused trough specification and appropriate allocation of rights to people. This is revolutionary especially in comparison to the dynasties and empires we have previously studied, where there were such stark contrasts in power dynamics between rulers and common-people.
