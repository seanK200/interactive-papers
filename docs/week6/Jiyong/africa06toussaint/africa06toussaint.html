        <i><b><p>Letter to General Etienne Laveaux, May 1794</i></b></p>
          <p>
            It is very true, general, that I was led into error by the enemies
            of the Republic [of France] and of mankind, but who is the man who
            can hope to avoid all the traps of the wicked ? Indeed, I fell into
            their nets, but not without reason . . . the Spanish offered me
            their protection, and freedom for all those who fought for the
            kings’ cause; and having always fought to possess this same freedom,
            I clung to their offer, seeing myself abandoned by the French, my
            brothers. But an experience a little later opened my eyes to these
            treacherous protectors; and being aware of their deceipt and
            villainy, I saw clearly that their intentions were to make us cut
            each other’s throats in order to reduce our numbers and oppress
            those remaining in chains and cause them to sink back into their
            former slavery. No, they never would reach their base goal! And in
            our turn we will avenge ourselves of those wretched beings in every
            respect. Thus let us unite forever and, forgetting the past,
            henceforth concern ourselves only with crushing our enemies...
          </p>
          <p><b><i>Letter to the People of Verrettes, March 1795</i></b></p>
          <p>
            Brothers and sisters, The moment has arrived when the thick veil
            that was blocking the light must fall. One must no longer forget the
            decrees of the National Convention. Its principles, its love of
            liberty, are unchanging, and henceforth, there can be no hope of
            this sacred edifice crumbling. . .
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learned with infinite joy about the return of some citizens
            of Verrettes to the bosom of the Republic; they will find the
            happiness that eluded them at the instigation of the soldiers of
            tyranny and royalty. . . . To give them help, console them regarding
            past faults and prompt them to abjure the errors in which they were
            insidiously nourished, is an absolute duty and the sacred maxim of
            the French for all republicans.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why not only by virtue of the powers entrusted by General
            Laveaux, but also animated \ by the feelings of humanity and
            brotherhood with which I am filled, I must remind the citizens of
            Verrettes of their errors; but as much as they are detrimental to
            the interests of the Republic, as much I feel that their return,
            sincere, can be advantageous to the growth of our success. . .
          </p>
          <p>
            The French are our brothers; the English, the Spanish, and royalists
            are ferocious beasts who caress them only in order to suck their
            blood, that of their wives, and of their children at leisure, until
            satiation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Citizens, I am not searching here to make a show of your faults...
            You have returned to the bosom of the Republic, and well! Since then
            the past is forgotten; your duty is now to unite all of your
            physical and moral means to revive your parish and let the
            principles of sacred liberty germinate.
          </p>
          
          <p><b><i>Letter to the Directory, October 28, 1797</i></b></p>
          <p>
            If, upon the arrival of the [investigating] Commission [from
            France], St. Domingue groaned under a military government, this
            power was not in the hands of the blacks; they were subordinate to
            it, and they only executed the orders of General Laveaux. These were
            the blacks who, when France was threatened with the loss of this
            Colony, employed their arms and their weapons to conserve it, to
            reconquer the greatest part of its territory that treason had handed
            over to the Spanish and English.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such was the conduct of those blacks in whose hands citizen Vienot
            Vaublanc said the military government of St. Domingue found itself,
            such are those negroes he accuses of being ignorant and gross;
            undoubtedly they are, because without education there can only be
            ignorance and grossness. But must one impute to them the crime of
            this educational deficiency or, more correctly, accuse those who
            prevented them by the most atrocious punishments from obtaining it?
            And are only <a>civilized people</a> capable of distinguishing between good
            and evil, of having notions of charity and justice? The men of St.
            Domingue have been deprived of an education; but even so, they no
            longer remain in a state of nature, and because they haven’t arrived
            at the degree of perfection that education bestows, they do not
            merit being classed apart from the rest of mankind, being confused
            with animals. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Undoubtedly, one can reproach the inhabitants of St. Domingue,
            including the blacks, for many faults, even terrible crimes. But eve
            in France, where the limits of sociability are clearly drawn,
            doesn’t one see its inhabitants, in the struggle between despotism
            and liberty, going to all the excesses for which the blacks are
            reproached by their enemies? The fury of the two parties has been
            equal in St. Domingue; and if the excesses of the blacks in these
            critical moments haven’t exceeded those committed in Europe, must
            not an impartial judge pronounce in favor of the former?
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is our enemies themselves who present us as ignorant and
            gross, aren’t we more excusable than those who, unlike us, were not
            deprived of the advantages of education and civilization? Surrounded
            by fierce enemies, oft cruel masters; without any other support than
            the charitable intentions of the friends of freedom in France, of
            whose existence we were hardly aware; driven to excessive errors by
            opposing parties who were rapidly destroying each other; knowing, at
            first, only the laws of the Mother-Country that favored the
            pretensions of our enemies and, since our liberty, receiving only
            the semiyearly or yearly instructions of our government, and no
            assistance, but almost always slanders or diatribes from our old
            oppressors—how can we not be pardoned some moments of ill-conduct,
            some gross faults, of which we were the first victims? Why, above
            all, reflect upon unreproachable men, upon the vast majority of the
            blacks, the faults of the lesser part, who, in time, had been
            reclaimed by the attentions of the majority to order and respect for
            the superior authorities?...
          </p>
          <p>
            If General Rochambeau had reflected philosophically on the course of
            events, especially those of the human spirit, he would not find it
            so astonishing that the laws of liberty and equality were not
            precisely established in an American country whose connection with
            the Mother Country had been neglected for so long; he would have
            felt that at a time when Europeans daily perjured themselves by
            handing over their quarters to the enemies of their country,
            prudence dictated that Government entrust its defense to the men of
            color and blacks whose interests were intimately linked to the
            triumph of the Republic; he would have felt that the military
            government then ruling the colony, by giving great power to the
            district commanders, could have led them astray in the labyrinths of
            uncertainty resulting from the absence of laws; he would have
            recalled that Martinique, defended by Europeans, fell prey to the
            English, whereas, St. Domingue, defended by the blacks and men of
            color whom Rochambeau accuses, remained constantly faithful to
            France.
          </p>
          <p><b><i>
            Letter to the Minister of Marine, April 13, 1799
          </p></b></i>
          The first successes obtained in Europe by the partisans of liberty
          over the agents of despotism were not slow to ignite the sacred fire
          of patriotism in the souls of all Frenchmen in St. Domingue. At that
          time, men’s hopes turned to France, whose first steps toward her
          regeneration promised them a happier future; ... they [the French
          colonists] wanted to escape from their arbitrary government, but they
          did not intend the revolution to destroy either the prejudice that
          debased the men of color or the slavery of the blacks, whom they held
          in dependency by the strongest law. In their opinion, the benefits of
          the French regeneration were only for them. They proved it by their
          obstinate refusal to allow the people of color to enjoy their
          political rights and the slaves to enjoy the liberty that they
          claimed. Thus, while the white were erecting another form of
          government upon the rubble of despotism, the men of color and the
          blacks united themselves in order to claim their political existence;
          the resistance of the former having become stronger, it was necessary
          for the latter to rise up in order to obtain [political recognition]
          by force of arms. The whites, fearing that this legitimate resistance
          would bring general liberty to St. Domingue, sought to separate the
          men of color from the cause of the blacks in accordance with
          Machiavelli’s principle of divide and rule. Renouncing their claims
          over the men of color, they accepted the <a>April Decree [1792]</a>. As they
          had anticipated, the men of color, many of whom were slaveholders, had
          only been using the blacks to gain their own political demands.
          Fearing the enfranchisement of the blacks, the men of color deserted
          their comrades in arms, their companions in misfortune, and aligned
          themselves with the whites to subdue them.
        </p>
          <p>
            Treacherously abandoned, the blacks fought for some time against he
            reunited whites and the men of color; but, pressed on all sides,
            losing hope, they accepted the offers of the Spanish king, who,
            having at that time declared war on France, <a>offered freedom to those
            blacks</a> of St. Domingue who would join his armies. Indeed, the
            silence of pre-Republican France on the longstanding claims for
            their natural rights made by the most interested, the noblest, the
            most useful portion of the population of <a>St. Domingue</a> ...
            extinguished all glimmer of hope in the hears of the black slaves
            and forced them, in spite of themselves, to throw themselves into
            the arms of a protective power that offered the only benefit for
            which they would fight. More unfortunate than guilty, they turned
            their arms against their fatherland….

            L’Ouverture in his Selected Letters from 1794-1799 reveal a great deal about his focuses at the time: his internal consciousness regarding his mistaken allegiance to the Spanish, his call to action to the People of Verrettes for liberty and his explanation of the actions of uneducated blacks to the Directory. In reading each of these letters, it brings about the questions of what his writings reveal about his person as well as how they evoke Enlightenment and revolutionary ideas through his diction. In examining all of them, it becomes apparent that L’Ouverture writes with the purpose of catalyzing change in his society. He does this by using the appeal to reason, as he presents a coherent argument in his first letter, conceding his mistake of trusting the Spanish (”It is very true, general, that I was led into error by the enemies of the republic and of mankind…Indeed, I fell into their nets”). As a leader, he is still able to admit fault but provides reason of his greater intentions and promotion for progress (”No, they never would reach their base goal!”). Secondly, in his Letter to the People of Verrettes, his language is impassioned (”Your duty is now unite all of your physical and moral means to revive your parish and let the principles of sacred liberty germinate”). He calls on his “brothers and sisters” of the Haitian city to advance values such as liberty, progress, fraternity, highlighting Enlightenment themes. While also pointing out the citizens’ faults, he also ensures that he reminds them of their vital role to the Republic. Lastly, his Letter to the Directory presents a logical argument that explains the anarchic behavior of uneducated blacks that simply were threatened by the loss of St. Domingue. He argues that these blacks took up arms in order to preserve their territory. He brings up the question of moral judgment in accordance with education and tensions between the two, emphasizing his view that these uneducated blacks are not any different from mankind. L’Ouverture’s writings provide a keen insight on revolutionary and Enlightenment thinking as well as effective speech writing of him as a passionate leader.<br/><br/>Toussaint L’Ouverture’s letters lead to the question of how he justifies pairing with Spain to revolt against France. L’Ouverture was a leading figure in a slave revolt in the hopes of ending slavery and gaining equality. He gives evidence of how the French mistreated the slaves and men of color, even when they “remained constantly faithful to France.” His passage illustrates how the men hoped for change, and how they idealized a fair and just society. They remained loyal in the hopes of change, but France saw the slaves and color of men as inferior and refused to give them the tools, such as education, to become successful. Because the French wanted control, they put forward “Michiavelli’s principle of divide and rule” by turning the men of color against the black men. Instead of creating a better bond between France and the colony, the French chose a harsher method to keep control. The passage places an importance in the role of education because throughout the world literacy was becoming more important, and knowledge was more accessible. L’Ouverture was an educated individual who combined forces with others to create a successful rebellion. The revolt is “revolutionary” because many colonies failed to successfully rebel against its mother countries, but St. Domingue is one of the examples of a colony who strived for change and gained it.

            In his letter to General Laveaux, Tousaaint reports on his mistakes in battle - falling to the traps of Spanish nets of protection - and reassures the General that they will be avenged. Tousaaint and his troops, in alliance with the French Republic, made their revolution and repossession of Haiti possible.  In his letter address to the People of the Verrettes, he pardons the Haitian people of their past faults and reassures them to trust General Laveaux and the interests of the Republic. His purpose is to implant an “us vs them” mentality within the common people, illustrating that the French are “[their] brothers” and the Spanish and English are “ferocious beasts who caress them only to suck their blood” (6).  Tousaaint also challenges some ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly with this question he posed to the Directory; “are only civilized people capable of distinguishing between good and evil, of having notions of charity and justice?” (6). Here Tousaaint defends enslaved Africans who are viewed as “ignorant and gross” because of their educational deficiency, claiming that they are no longer in a “state of nature” and “do not merit being... confused with animals” (6). During this period of Enlightenment, Europeans such as Carolus Linneaus classified Africans as the “lowest rung of the human ladder” (516, Worlds Together Worlds Apart). It was very much a period defined by hierarchy and self-proclaimed supremacy of euro-thought, justifying scientific racism and other forms of exploitation. Although he stands apart for his education and military prowess, Tousaaint’s purpose in writing this letter was to humanize his fellow African Haitians and illustrate their loyalty to the French Republic.<br/><br/>The passage first starts by asking “how can we not be pardoned some moments of ill-conduct, some gross faults, of which we were the first victims?” The author advocates that “vast majority of the blacks” should “respect for the superior authorities”. America should execute the “laws of liberty and equality” Also, by trust the black and the “men of color” who share the same interest with them, the European can achieve the “the triumph of the Republic”(line 28), within which law enforcement shall be deemed as a path to success(line 30). In the second half the passage, the author brings up that the men of color and the black slaves should unify each other to obtain their political right and liberty that is made inaccessible for them due to the white superiority of French colonist(line 5). The “revolutionary” part comes right next to the April Decree in 1792, when the color, most of which are slave owners, collude with the white to subdue the black due to the fear of the black enfranchisement(line 25). In order to achieve desired liberty, as an “enlightenment” idea, the black turn to join the Spanish army to “declare war on France(line 30)”.

            The style that Toussaint uses in the letters is a sophisticated and formal style, that uses persuasion, rallies up the recipients of the letter, ignites a feeling of hope and acceptance and also initiates a call to action. This style of writing can be seen through the verbs, literary devices and language he uses. His letters have this aura of sophistication and formality, which the readers can see through his use of words like “detrimental”; “animated”; and “subordinate (pg 6, lines 33, 35, 49). This aura of sophistication most likely stemmed from the fact that he was a part of the enlightenment period, where intellect and philosophic ideas dominated everything in the mid 17th to 18th centuries. His style also sends a message of persuasion and incitement to readers by asking rhetorical questions (pg. 6, lines 4, 61) and the use of the oxymoron; treacherous protectors” (pg 6 lines 10-11). He also ignites a feeling of hope and inspiration when he mentioned: “the return of some citizens of Verrettes to the bosom of the Republic” (pg 6, lines 25-26). In the sentence above, he expresses concern and care for these returned citizens and extends a hand of affection and acceptance. Finally, he initiates a call for action for the unification of Saint Dominique through strong verbs such as “reproach”; “struggle”; “accuse” (pg 6, lines 59, 64, 67, 70). These letters are revolutionary, as it was a part of his duties as one of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution. These letters were all part of the successful slave revolt in St. Dominique.<br/><br/>In this passage, the style of writing utilized by Toussaint seems to be preachy in the first half of the page. This can be seen in the way Toussaint uses questions in order to justify why their Haitian Revolution was righteous and beneficial not only for the slaveswho were finally freed but also for France. Such questions included “how can we not be pardoned some moments of ill-conduct, some gross faults, of which we were the first victims?” and “why… reflect upon unreproachable men… the faults of the lesser part” (7). This style of writing then becomes more descriptive and more adjectives are used when describing the actions of both parties in order to invoke a sense of emotion and empathy for the rebelling slaves whilst painting the French in a more negative light. Toussaint describes the slaves as “treacherously abandoned” by their former colored allies and that the slaves had a “legitimate resistance” while the French on the other hand were “obstinate” in their refusals to give blacks freedom that they themselves had fought for in the French Revolution (7). Toussaint also uses terms like “fatherland” throughout his writing which can be assumed to be done in order to show that although they rebelled, they still see themselves as French citizens who just wanted the same freedom their former masters had fought for.

            The tone which Toussaint reveals in his letter during the Haitian revolution serves to be a primary resource containing Toussaint’s own political view and virtue as well as his power during the time. Toussaint calls the French their brothers but calls the english, the spanish and royalists a ferocious beasts. By this passage alone, we can assume that Toussaint that French has influenced Slaves to enlighten themselves and revolt. In letter to the directory, We see Toussaint cares about people from Santo Domingo the recent freed slaves and doesn’t want the slavery to be established again. Through his letters, we see well educated Black revolutionary as he is who defends people with no power.<br/><br/>The author was saying that, French people including him fell into the traps of wicked and they all should go back to their mother country to fix the error they made. The time when republican of France or artisan, decided to fight for their own country, most of the colonies already accepted the sweetest whisper of the devil, Spaniards, to have freedom if only they surrender to them. The document is dealing about St. Dominguez and the republican people in it, who kept their faith on France by defeating Spaniards and other European country. The black and the color of men in St. Domingue were part of people who had interests in the triumph of the Republican. During the time, black was neglected and ignored by others for they were under the law of slavery and of course, they had no education at all like the ordinary people. The blacks fought to find their political recognition unlike the others who fought for the liberty in St. Domingue under France. The color of men, who also known as slave-owners, did not want the freedom of blacks and they also thought the law for slavery is extremely strong, that it should never be stopped or prevented by the governor. When confliction had kept continued, Spaniard promised them to give benefit of their liberty under them. At the end, the plans were failed and there were no freedom they acquired.

            In Toussaint’s series of letters, different aspects of the concept of revolution are missing. In the first letter to General Etienne Laveaux, Toussaint fails to enlighten the general on what the actual incident was which resulted in him switching over to the French side: “But an experience a little later opened my eyes to these treacherous protectors” (p. 6). Here the reader can clearly pinpoint that Toussaint fails to mention the precise incident that led him to believing the Spanish were conniving and deceitful. In the second letter, a rationale to understand and explain the cruel practices, according to Toussaint, of the British and Spanish are lacking: “The English, the Spanish, and royalists are ferocious beasts who caress them only in order to suck their blood, that of their wives, and of their children at leisure, until satiation.” (p. 6). In the above quote it can be seen that Toussaint uses inflammatory language to arouse fear and anger towards the British and Spanish and doesn’t try and dissect their practices. Furthermore, in the third letter, Toussaint fails to provide another perspective to the Directory about other contributions to the colony’s revolution. This text reflects the Enlightenment as a time of nationalism and organized political states. Additionally, this piece shows the inclusion and acknowledgment of the contributions of people of color to revolutionary wars.<br/><br/>Although Toussiant’s letters effectively portrays the struggle and revolution of French slaves during the late 18th century, his letters lack significant context, purpose, and perspectives. Toussiant’s letters are sent to the “Directory” and the “Minister of Marine,” which for those unfamiliar with French government, are the French Revolutionary Government that was established from 1795 to 1799 and the General that was in charge of the French navy and colonies, respectively. With the aforementioned information, it is clear that Toussiant was addressing the French politicians and leaders to reconsider their stance on slavery and to “destroy either the prejudice that debased the men of color or the slavery of the blacks” (7). Despite Toussaint’s pleas for a more all-encompassing freedom throughout France, the French colonists and government failed to understand the gravity of their mistake in not granting freedom to their black slaves. In the end, “black slaves turned their arms against their fatherland” because Spain was the only “protective power that offered the only benefit for which they would fight,” freedom (7). Though Toussiant’s adequately explains the black slaves’ motivations for revolting against France, he fails to explain why “the men of color deserted their comrades in arms” (7). Furthermore, it is not known whether the Spanish king declared war on France due to the political uprising occurring within France and its respective colonies or there were other underlying reasons. Though Toussiant’s letters portray a morally chaotic environment during the French revolution, he fails to create a holistic picture of the events unfolding at the time.

            What is most surprising about this passage is Toussaint L’Ouverture’s harsh attitude towards his fellow freedmen. He describes by saying “those negroes he accuses of being ignorant and gross; undoubtedly they are, because without education there can only be ignorance and grossness” (6). This appears to be an unfairly harsh evaluation of people whose background is very similar to his own. He emphasizes thus the importance he associates with education, which seems a bit hypocritical considering he did not receive a structured formal education himself, but rather a smattering of tutoring from his godfather and Jesuit missionaries. However, considering he surely identified as a man of the Enlightenment as a Jacobin, his emphasis on education is actually not surprising, and he does make clear that just because these former slaves are not educated they are still human and not mere animals. It must have certainly been a revolutionary idea at the time to even suggest that blacks deserve equal access to education, considering this was more than 60 years before the end of slavery in the US. As we saw from Kant’s musings on race, even Enlightened men in the late 18th century were not exactly in favor of equality, but L’Ouverture’s unique position as a powerful political figure of color appears to lead to a more progressive stance on such issues. He also defends the apparent crimes of his fellow blacks by equating them to those of the revolutionaries in France, where the violence was no worse than in the Caribbean according to him. This also exposes another double standard of the Enlightenment when it comes to race relations, not that this is particularly surprising either. But apparently the “inhabitants of Saint-Domingue, including the blacks” were being criticized for being particularly violent in their fight for freedom. This may also have classist elements as well as racist ones, which would make much sense if it were coming from the Jacobins, a bourgeois political entity. This fact makes L’Ouverture’s membership somewhat confounding.<br/><br/>

            “More likely Toussaint was prepared to side with anyone, or turn against any former ally, if such a move was apt to benefit his cause. The only future he could visualize for Haiti was as a black government. The Negroes of Haiti were a majority. Therefore, he reasoned, they had the democratic right to manage their own affairs. The island had been run too long by minority of white men, toward whom he felt no loyalty whatsoever.” (53-54)<br/><br/>“The complaint was reasonable, but Toussaint spoiled its effect by concluding with a solemn promise to remain “loyal and faithful” to Spain. Yet when he wrote the dispatch, Toussaint already had planned to desert Spain at the earliest opportunity.” (55)<br/><br/>“In his [Napoleon] future dealings with Toussaint, he would regard the black liberator as a man who had demonstrated that he never could be trusted.” (59)

            “Toussaint refused to rally to the French republican cause until the French abolished slavery in February 1794. In this his first letter to the French general, Toussaint accounts for his previous decision to fight on with the Spanish forces until May.” (9)<br/><br/>“[…] It is true, General, that I have been led into error by the enemies of the Republic and humanity, but what man can flatter himself to have avoided all the traps of evil men? In truth, I fell into their nets, not without knowing what I was doing; you will remember that […] my goal was only that we unite to combat the enemies of France and to bring an end to an internal war among the French of this colony.” (9)<br/><br/>“At the time, the Spanish offered me their protection and freedom for all those who fought for the cause of kings. Having always fought to achieve this same liberty, I accepted their offer, seeing myself abandoned by the French, my brothers.” (10)<br/><br/>“I am utterly unlike many others who witness scenes of horror in cold blood. I have always held humanity in common to all, and I suffer whenever I cannot prevent evil. There were also a number of uprisings in the workshops, but I rapidly returned things to order and all are working as before.” (10)

            “ The general consensus of opinion among Haitian written is that Toussaint L’Ouverture changed from being the leader of a slave revolt into a Spanish general only that he might make the purpose of the revolt and his own purpose more sure of accomplishment.” (83)<br/><br/>“Toussaint, although not counting himself a Spaniard, was, at the time to which our narrative now brings us, the most powerful military commander the Spanish government had in the island; indeed, it can be truthfully said that he and his army constituted the only respectable fore that Spain was employing in this war.” (85)<br/><br/>“Toussaint was always the man of judgment and action, not of imagination, sentiment, and emotion. He decided to leave the service of Spain without apology or explanation. Gonaives has surrendered to him and from a military point of view his position was flattering.” (86)

            “Most black generals had been fighting alongside France’s enemies. But the Royalists, the Spanish, and the British were all pro-slavery. In May 1794, therefore, Toussaint L’Ouverture broke with his allies and joined the French Republicans. His new allegiance was confirmed when news reached Haiti of the National Convention’s emancipation decree. Toussaint had become, as West Indian historian C L R James describes him, a ‘Black Jacobin’. He was now waging all-out war for the abolition of slavery.”<br/><br/>“At critical historical turning-points, revolutionary leadership can be decisive. Revolutionary leadership is neither purely utopian, nor purely pragmatic, but involves a dialectical meshing of the two. It requires a vision of an alternative future which transcends immediate circumstances yet reflects possibilities incubating inside them. It means looking forwards to a new world while remaining anchored in the old. This was the role assumed by Toussaint L’Ouverture and his army in 1794.”<br/><br/>
