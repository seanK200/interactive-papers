          <p>
            Sirs, the commerce [the merchant community] of France has made known
            to you its wishes and its worries on several objects in which it is
            interested, and particularly on the various relations between France
            and her <a>colonies</a>. At the same time that these petitions [from
            French merchants] were addressed to you, news arrived from Saint
            Domingue and Martinique that held all of your attention. You sensed
            the necessity of taking, with regard to the colonies, a wise and
            prompt resolution. And perceiving an intimate connection between the
            causes of their [the two colonies’] agitation and the requests of
            commerce, you named a committee to investigate these together and
            present to you an outcome proper to reconcile the various interests.
            In discerning, Sirs, the goals of our mission, we soon recognized
            that all the questions that are presented reduce themselves, at the
            present moment, to extremely simple terms. The interest of the
            French nation to support its commerce, to preserve its colonies, and
            to favor their prosperity by every means compatible with the
            interests of the metropole [homeland], appeared to us, by every
            point of view, as an incontestable truth. The measures to take, in
            order to achieve this, appeared to us not less clearly indicated by
            the principles and by the circumstances. Reassure the colonies on
            their mot dear interests, receive from the instructions on the
            system of government which is convenient to their prosperity and
            that it is finally time to establish; invite them to present their
            views, concurrently with French commerce, on their reciprocal
            relations: such is the procedure that the circumstances, justice,
            and reason have appeared to prescribe to us. . . . It is not a
            question, in fact, of examining if France should seek to establish a
            commerce or to found some colonies. These things already exist. At
            the moment in which we are speaking, all the aspects of our social
            existence are intimately linked and merged with the existence of
            large-scale trade with our colonies. Thus, it is only a question of
            knowing if the suppression, if the sudden loss of these immense
            resources would not produce a violent and destructive jolt, would
            not be a great disaster for the nation? It is a question of knowing
            above all if, in our present situation, engaged in a revolution of
            which the completion assures forever the glory and prosperity of the
            French nation and of which the failure will plunge the French nation
            into an unfathomable evil, this violent jolt would not present the
            most formidable stumbling block; if the situation of our finances
            would not suffer from this a blow without remedy; if the force of
            the malcontents would not increase from this beyond all proportion;
            if, finally, the constitution, which alone would be able with time
            to repair these great calamities, would not be itself overthrown by
            this. When one is willing to consider the question from these points
            of view, the question no longer will present any doubts; one will
            appreciate that it is necessary above all, to prevent the evils that
            most closely menace us, and that all other speculations become
            foreign when it is a question of the sacred interest of the
            Revolution and of the destiny of the several million Frenchmen who
            are attached to the prosperity of our commerce, to the possession of
            our colonies.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be, in fact, the fruit of a great ignorance, or of a
            strange evil faith, to claim to separate the prosperity of national
            commerce from the possessions of our colonies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our <a data-ip-footnote-id="colonies1">colonies</a> not only constitute the greatest portion of our
            maritime and exterior relations, but the value of our agricultural
            produce, the activity of our industries, our transports, our
            internal commerce, are, in large measure, the effect of our
            relations with the colonies. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Abandon the <a>colonies,</a> and these sources of prosperity will disappear
            or diminish.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Abandon the colonies,</a> and you will import, at great price,
            from foreigners what they buy today from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Abandon the colonies at the moment when your establishments there
            are based on possessing them, and listlessness will replace
            activity, misery abundance: the mass of workers, of useful and
            hardworking citizens, will pass quickly from a state of ease into
            the most deplorable situation; finally, agriculture and our finances
            will soon be struck by the same disaster experienced in commerce and
            manufactures.
          </p>
          <p>
            And how easy would it be, in carrying these issues further, to
            establish the relationship of this branch of our commerce with all
            its other branches, with our maritime existence, and with the
            general system of European power? . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            You should only, you can only speak here one language, that of
            truth, which consists in disavowing the false extension that has
            been given [to some of your decrees]. You have not been able to
            change anything in all of what concerns the colonies, for the laws
            that you have decreed did not have them in mind; you have not been
            able to change anything because public security and humanity itself
            would offer insurmountable obstacles to what your hearts have
            inspired in you [the abolition of the slave trade or of slavery
            itself]. Let us say ti then at this moment, since doubts have been
            raised: you have broken no new ground. This declaration will
            suffice; it can leave no alarm remaining. It is only just to
            accompany it with an arrangement suitable for reassuring the
            colonies against those who, with criminal plots, would seek to bring
            trouble there, to excite uprisings there. These men whom some have
            affected to confuse with peaceful citizens occupied with seeking
            through reflection means for softening the destiny of the most
            unfortunate portion of the most unfortunate portion of the
            reflection means for softening the destiny of the most unfortunate
            portion of the human race [the slaves], these men, I say, only have
            perverse motives and can only be considered as enemies of France and
            of humanity. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Here then, Sirs, is the project for a decree that your committee has
            unanimously voted to propose to you: . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Declares that, considering the colonies as a part of the <a>French
            empire</a>, and desiring to enable them to enjoy the fruits of the happy
            regeneration that has been accomplished in the empire, it never
            intended to include them in the constitution that it has decreed for
            the kingdom or to subject them to laws which might be incompatible
            with their particular, local proprieties. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the National Assembly declares that it never intended to
            introduce innovations into any of the branches of indirect or direct
            commerce between France and its colonies [thus it leaves the slave
            trade untouched] and hereby puts the colonists and their properties
            under the special protection of the nation and declares criminal,
            toward the nation, whoever works to excite uprisings against them.
