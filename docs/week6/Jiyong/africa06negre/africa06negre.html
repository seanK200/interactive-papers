            Man who inhabits different parts of the earth, from the Tropic of
            Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Africa has no other inhabitants
            but the blacks. Not only the color, but also the facial traits
            distinguish them from other men: large and flat noses, thick lips,
            and wool instead of hair. They appear to constitute a new species of
            mankind.

            If one moves further away from the Equator toward the Antarctic, the
            black skin becomes lighter, but the <a>ugliness remains</a>: one
            finds there this same wicked people that inhabits the African
            Meridian. If one goes east, the features soften and become more
            regular, but the skin color remains black as inside Africa. After
            these [eastern peoples], one encounters a greatly tanned people,
            distinguishable from others by their narrow and obliquely positioned
            long eyes. If we pass through this vast part of the world which
            appears to be separate from Europe, from Africa and Asia, one finds
            – if several travelers are to be believed – a different human
            variety. There is absolutely no white person: the land is peopled by
            red nations tanned in a thousand ways…

            Many physicians have researched the causes of the blackness of the
            negro. The major opinions that the physicians hold on this manner
            can be reduced to two:
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="attributes">
              one attributes the cause to bile, the other to some fluid
              contained in the veins of the mucous membrane.
            </a>
            Malpighi, Ruysch, Littre, Santorini, Heiftner, and Albinus have done
            intriguing researches on the skin of the negroes. The first opinion
            on the blackness of the negro is entirely supported by proofs in a
            work entitled Dissertation sur la cause physique de la couleur des
            negres, etc. by M. Barrere (Paris, 1741). The following is how he
            deduced his hypothesis: when after a long maceration of the black
            skin in water, the outer skin is removed an attentively examined,
            one finds that it is black, very thin, and
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="attributes2"
              >transparent when held up to daylight.</a
            >
            That is how I saw it in America, and it has been remarked upon as
            well by the anatomists of our time, such as M. Winslow… It would be,
            in fact, the fruit of a great ignorance, or of a strange evil faith,
            to claim to separate the prosperity of national commerce from the
            possessions of our colonies.
          </p>
          It needs to be further observed, however, that if the outer skin of
          the negro is transparent, the color becomes pronounced in the
          under-skin, which is reddish-brown, bordering on the dark. But since
          the skin of the black, like that of the white, is made up of veins, it
          must necessarily contain some juice. The results of the examination of
          this juice are at present in question. However, one can say with some
          basis that the juice is analogous to the bile, an opinion supported by
          observation, (1) On the cadavers of the Negroes whom I had the
          opportunity to dissect in Cayenne,1 the bile is always as dark as ink;
          and (2) it is always more or less black in proportion to the skin
          color of the negro; (3) the blood is blackish-red, again according to
          the grade of blackness of the negro’s skin; (4) it is certain that the
          bile re-enters the chyle in the blood, and flows with it through all
          parts of the body…<br />
          <br />
          The vessels of the mucous body, following the observations of
          Malpighi: the skin and the cuticle of the negroes are white; the
          blackness comes only from the mucous or the reticular membrane which
          is between the epidermis and the skin. Ruysch’s injections have partly
          confirmed this discovery, and brought them to light. The outer skin of
          the negro is not white, according to this anatomy, because it has the
          whiteness of a [animal’s] horn (blancheur de la corne), which is
          always has a mixture of black. Ruysch sent to Heifter a portion of the
          skin of a negro. It was white, certainly, but the external surface of
          the epidermis was black-tainted, the inside face was covered as well
          with deep, black taint. Santorini, in his Remarques anatomiques,
          reports of observations that establish the cause of the color of the
          Negroes in the mucous membrane. These researches prove that, if the
          Negro's epidermis was lifted, there remains an extremely black colored
          portion of the mucous membrane, on the skin or the vascular tissues.
          This black portion of the mucous membrane is what leaves black stain
          on the fingers that lifted the epidermis. There is, as a result, a
          particular reservoir of this black taint between the epidermis and the
          skin. <br />
          <br />
          The mucous membrane, a tissue almost unknown, appears to be quite
          unequally distributed in different parts of the body. It is closely
          attached to the epidermis, and could not be entirely separated from
          it, and that is why the black color cannot be erased off of the outer
          skin, and is of a deeper texture in the teguments of the inner
          surface. The vessels of the reticular membrane are full of blackish
          liquor (liqueur noirâtre). One may ask where this comes from.
          Santorini did not believe that one can decide on the source of this
          material which taints the reticular membrane of the negroes; but he
          suspected that the liver could furnish the taint of the skin in this
          human species. The red color of the fish's liver, various sorts of
          jaundice to which humans are subject, and the blackishness that one
          finds in the bile vesicles, <a>led him to this conjecture</a>. The
          vessels of the mucous body, following the observations of Malpighi

          ><br /><br />Johann Heinrich Samuel Formey (French: Jean Henri Samuel
          Formey; 31 May 1711 – 7 March 1797) was a German churchman, educator,
          author, and journalist. The son of an immigrant French family, he
          preached, taught, and wrote in French. A founding member of the Berlin
          Academy, he wrote thousands of letters, popularized scientific and
          philosophical ideas, and also contributed to Diderot’s
          <i>Encyclopédie</i>.

            >Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and
            Crafts</i
          >), better known as <i>Encyclopédie</i>, was a general encyclopedia
          published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements,
          revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the
          Encyclopédistes. It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759,
          co-edited by Jean le Rond d’Alembert.<br /><br />The
          <i>Encyclopédie</i> is most famous for representing the thought of the
          Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article
          "Encyclopédie", the <i>Encyclopédie</i>’s aim was "to change the way
          people think" and for people to be able to inform themselves and to
          know things. He and the other contributors advocated for the
          secularization of learning away from the Jesuits. Diderot wanted to
          incorporate all of the world’s knowledge into the
          <i>Encyclopédie</i> and hoped that the text could disseminate all this
          information to the public and future generations.<br /><br />It was
          also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named
          contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe
          the mechanical arts. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes
          were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published
          without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience
          within Europe.
