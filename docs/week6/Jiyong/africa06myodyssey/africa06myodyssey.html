            How often, from what I have seen, have I been able to recognize the
            injustice of those written diatribes, that were flooding Europe,
            against the poor planters of Saint Domingue! What lies! What
            exaggerated pictures! What ignorance of the country, the customs,
            the habits, and the laws. During the past months, between the
            different revolts and insurrections, I have seen everywhere Negroes
            who were <a>fat, well cared for, and happy.</a> I have seen them
            many times, about a <a>hundred of them</a> occupied with work that
            twenty Europeans could achieve in much less time. Their cabins
            appeared sanitary, commodious, and furnished with the necessary
            utensils for their needs. These cabins were surrounded with land
            where they raised pigs and a variety of fowl; they had me observe
            their individual gardens, which were perfectly tended and abundantly
            planted with all the necessary products of our country. I noticed
            that the hospital was the finest edifice of each plantation. I was
            told that a doctor visited them each day and that women looked after
            the sick. Other women had the care of the children, to bathe, comb,
            etc. each morning. I often found idle groups, and was told that
            these were convalescents, nursing mothers, pregnant women, and old
            people, who were exempt from service. . . . For those who question
            the discipline under which they live, it is certainly not more
            rigorous than that which is observed for soldiers and sailors; and
            when one realizes that thirty thousand whites are in the center of
            six hundred thousand <a>semibarbaric</a> Africans, one should not
            hesitate to say that discipline is necessary. The young adult
            Negroes of our plantation, informed of our return, gathered in a
            crowd before us, and by a thousand bizarre demonstrations testified
            to the joy they had in seeing us. . . . My voyage has offered you
            nothing so far but about agreeable happenings to me; but, Oh, my
            friend, what a cruel account I must now make to you! The day after
            my arrival, while partaking with my family of the pleasures of an
            excellent lunch, a courier arrived to deliver to my step-father,
            commander of the district in which our property is located, a letter
            full of the most terrifying news. The slaves, enflamed by emissaries
            sent from France, had burned the habitations of our neighbors near
            the Cape, after assassinating the proprietors without distinction of
            age or sex. Already the insurrection was causing devastation on all
            sides, and they feared it would soon reach our place of habitation.
            The report of this terrific catastrophe was widely spread. The
            frightened families among our neighbors met together at our
            plantation. The men armed to face the storm; the mothers, wives,
            sisters were lamenting and gathering in all haste a few precious
            effects. Desolation and fear were painted on all faces. The sky
            seemed on fire. Guns could be heard from afar and the bells of the
            plantations were sounding the alarm. The danger increased. The
            flames at each moment were approaching the enclosing about us. There
            was no time to lose; we fled. The victims who escaped at sword’s
            point came to swell the number of fugitives, and recounted to us the
            horrors which they had witnessed. They had seen unbelievable
            tortures to which they testified. Many women, young, beautiful, and
            virtuous, perished beneath the infamous caresses of the brigands,
            amongst the cadavers of their fathers and husbands. Bodies, still
            palpitating, were dragged through the roads with atrocious
            acclamation. Young children transfixed upon the points of bayonets
            were the bleeding flags which followed the troop of cannibals. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            [The following day, the author joins a small contingent of French
            militia troops.]<br /><br />
            We were sitting down to dinner when
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="signal"
              >we saw their [the rebel slaves] signal, which is always the
              burning of some stalks of sugar-cane</a
            >. Our general, a man of appetite as well as of combat, decided we
            should continue with our repast, and after giving several orders for
            the safety of our quarters, sat down to dinner. We were eating
            heartily until the moment a cannonball passed through the window and
            carried away, right under our beards, the table and all the plates.
            The general, infuriated by this mishap, mounted his horse with food
            still in his mouth, and left camp with six hundred men and four
            pieces of artillery. Two hours later one could not find a living
            Negro within a circle of two and a half miles, and the roads were
            strewn with their bloody remains. . . . <br /><br />
            I pursued a Negro whose regalia caused me to judge him to be one of
            the principal chiefs. As I was about to overtake him, he turned
            around, took aim, but happily for me, could not make his powder fire
            as it was too damp. I prepared myself to cleave his head with my
            sword, whereupon he fell to his knees, kissed my boots, and told me,
            with tears in his eyes, that he was my Mother’s godson, that he was
            present at my birth, and carried me in his arms more than once, and
            beseeched me not to kill him; that he was a good Negro and that he
            had always loved the Whites. His manner disarmed me; I dismounted
            from my horse before having him conducted to camp. However, a soft
            sound made me quickly turn my head, and I saw the miserable
            hypocrite, who had recharged his gun, aiming point-blank at my head;
            being troubled at finding himself discovered, prevented him from
            aiming accurately, and the bullet went past me. I fell upon him but
            he was on guard for my attack; and there we were both acting as if
            playing Prisoner’s Base. I caught my runner at the moment when he
            was about to slash me and threw him into some weeds. Even then he
            had the impudence to maintain that I had not seen correctly , and
            that he loved the son of his godmother too much to try to kill him.
            When he heard himself convicted by a number of soldiers who had just
            arrived and had witnessed the incident, he changed his tune and told
            me in his jargon: “Master, I know that is true. It is the Devil who
            gets inside of this body of mine. I am a good nigger, but against my
            will the Devil is too strong.” His excuse made me laugh despite my
            anger, and had I been alone,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="certainly"
              >I would certainly have saved him; but the soldiers seized him and
              bound him to a tree to be shot.</a
            >
            When he saw that his fate was sealed, he began to laugh, sing, and
            joke. At times, however, reviling us in a furious tone, at times
            jeering at us in mockery. He gave the signal himself and met death
            without fear or complaint. We found in one of his pockets pamphlets
            printed in France, filled with commonplaces about the Rights of Man
            and the Sacred [French] Revolution; in his vest was a large packet
            of tinder and phosphate of lime. On his chest he had a little sack
            full of hair, herbs, bits of bone, which they call a fetish; with
            this, they expect to be sheltered from all danger; and it was, no
            doubt, because of this amulet, that our man had the intrepidity
            which the philosophers call Stoicism.

          (Q) The word "barbaric" was used in multiple instances to describe
          Africans. On the other hand, these texts associate words such as art,
          writing, fair, sanguine, and brawn with Europeans. What is it Africans
          that are so barbaric to Europeans, and what about barbarism do
          Europeans find so revolting? Are such ideals aftermath of the

            This reading selection written by an anonymous (and presumably
            white?) individual left me with a couple questions -- one that is
            more specific to the individual’s experience and another one that
            addresses the general sentiment toward African folks at the time.
            When the African man was arrested and tied to the tree to be shot,
            the narrator says, “had I been alone, I would have saved him (p.1).”
            This left me wondering why the narrator would save the man after
            having clearly expressed his disgust for him and other Africans:
            “and when one realizes that thirty thousand whites are in the center
            of six hundred thousand semibarbaric Africans, one should not
            hesitate to say that discipline is necessary (p.1).” Another
            question that I couldn’t help but think throughout the course of
            this reading was “how was the education system during this time
            period? And what sorts of things were taught specifically about
            Africans?” This question didn’t exactly have a direct answer in the
            reading, but my guess is, Africans were not spoken of very highly in
            an education curriculum. This reading is particularly interesting
            because the connection to the Enlightenment isn’t clear until the
            very last line: “and it was, no doubt, because of this amulet, that
            our man had the intrepidity which the philosophers called Stoicism
            (p.1).” After researching, I found that the definition of Stoicism
            is “the endurance of pain or hardship without a display of feelings
            and without complaint.” This was exhibited by the African, which was
            extremely interesting because he illustrated a phenomena that was
            defined/studied by the elite philosophers.

            The Haitian Revolution is a chaotic revolt carried by Negroes who
            were “enlightened” by ideas from the French Enlightenment. This text
            is written in the perspective of a white male who was present in the
            course of the revolt. Using adjectives such as “assassinating”,
            “lamenting”, “desolation and fear”, “torture”, “horror”, and “troop
            of cannibals” we see that despite the probability of the author
            carrying a disliking for Negroes, the nature of the Haitian
            Revolution is indeed bloody and violent. What’s more, we can also
            see that the ideas of the French Enlightenment justified the violent
            event. The revolution turned to mass destruction in part that the
            Enlightenment ideas of rights and freedom drew the attention of the
            slaves towards their pre-existing mistreatment and oppression.

            My Odyssey written anonymously is written in a very descriptive
            style detailing the occurrence of a conflict amongst slaves and
            their owners. The writer describes the scene in much detail, stating
            that the “many women, young, beautiful, and virtuous” had been
            killed amongst their relatives as a result of the battle. The writer
            manages to discuss the scene within a span of two days. The focus
            midway through the passage shifts from the plot being stated to a
            specific encounter with a slave and a white whom according to the
            slave, his relative. The writer describes in specificity the ongoing
            encounter between the two, which leads to the death of the slave at
            the end of the passage, who had the courage to be associated with
            what was known by philosophers as stoicism.

          <div class="footnote" id="[13]">
            An anonymous first-hand account titled “My Odyssey” describes the
            aftermath of the San Domingo slave uprisings that resulted in the
            founding of the independent state of Haiti. Like many
            European-centered descriptions of the event, the piece focuses on
            the violence committed by the slaves against their white masters,
            and on a denunciation of the slaves’ moral and cognitive abilities.
            In a passage characteristic of the piece, the writer describes the
            acts of violence against women perpetrated by the slaves: “Many
            women, young, beautiful, and virtuous, perished beneath the infamous
            caresses of the brigands, amongst the cadavers of their fathers and
            husbands” (p. 5) What “My Odyssey” fails to mention, of course, is
            the widespread and institutionalized rape committed by the French
            against African slaves, so ingrained into the society of San Domingo
            that it created a distinct class of people of mixed heritage. The
            context of the everyday violence of slavery is, of course, left out
            of this account. Historian C.L.R. James writes that the acts of
            retribution of the slaves were considerably more moderate than the
            tortures of the slave masters. Still, they inflicted great violence
            on the whites: “From their masters they had known rape, torture,
            degradation, and, at the slightest provocation, death. They returned
            in kind.” (James The Black Jacobins p.88) When one omits the
            savagery of the slave masters, the violence of the slaves becomes
            simply random violence. Instead, the horrific acts they perpetrated
            on their former abusers must be interpreted through the lens of
            political resistance, as the metaphorical “harvest” that was sown
            during the time of slavery.

            The first missing aspect of this passage is the author. We don’t
            know who wrote this narration but we know that this narrator is a
            white man (I’m assuming Frenchman based upon the context).
            Furthermore, we do not know what caused the slaves to suddenly
            revolt and burn down homes. What happened between the narrator’s
            arrival and the slave’s initiation of rebellion? As the passage
            continues, the narrator mentions a cannonball coming in through the
            window, but there’s no description as to how the cannon was attained
            or really any perspective from the slaves regarding this situation.
            The only actual interaction the narrator has with the slaves is when
            the narrator’s godson is attempting to kill the narrator. What is
            missing from this situation is why the slave is shifting from one
            mood to the next -- asking for mercy then attempting to murder the
            narrator, then showing no fear in death when tied up to a tree to be
            shot. At the end of this passage it is revealed that there were
            pamphlets written in French found in the slave’s pockets, but this
            brings up the point of “when did the slave learn how to read?” and
            lacks the description of where the slave learned about stoicism.
            This passage exemplifies Enlightenment ideas by showing a man of far
            less status than the previously talked about scholars, noblemen,
            philosophers, etc, presenting his own idea for a decision, and
            execution of such decision without guidance. The revolutionary
            aspect of this text is that the slaves use the idea of Stoicism as a
            initiation point and believe in items for “shelter from all danger”
            to provoke a change, a revolt, in reaction to what appears to be
            mistreatment.

            In this passage, the author described the battle between Europeans
            and Negro slaves. Despite the cruelty and intensity of the battle in
            the passage that makes me surprised --’Bodies,still palpitating,
            were drugged through the roads with atrocious acclamation’(5), the
            most surprising fact happened between the fight of the author
            himself and a Negro who seemed to be one of the principal chiefs.
            Although the cunning Negro tried to deceive the author by claiming
            that ‘he was my Mother’s godson’, and by claiming that he was
            induced by the Devil, the last image before his death impressed me
            -- ‘He gave the signal himself and met death without fear or
            complaint’ (5). Acting like a coward and hypocrite before getting
            caught, the Negro gave me the impression of a cunning and coward
            chief. However, his behavior when facing the death indicates his
            bravery. This might reveal the initial of the battle that the slaves
            got inspired and enlightened to fight against the European slavers.
            In this passage, Enlightenment plays an important role of the battle
            and the behaviors of the slaves. The reason that they were acting
            cruelly and atrociously is that they wanted to fight for their
            ‘Rights of Men’ and their liberty. Just as the pocket pamphlet found
            in the Negro’s dead body, which says ‘Rights of Men and the Sacred
            Revolution’, these two spirits inspired oppressed slaves to fight
            for liberty.

          “It was a response to religious and political oppression by the French
          colonialists that Voodoo religion developed as an underground
          religion- political institution. The various independent Voodoo cults
          maintained their separate ritual traditions. Their overseers were the
          Voodoo priests who were either chiefs over maroon communities
          -settlements of run- away slaves (what Laguerre calls "political
          exiles") - or over cults centered on plantations. Although there was
          no Voodoo pope to establish a standard doctrine or ritual, the various
          Voodoo cults united repeatedly for the purpose of winning their
          liberation from French colonialism [33-34].”(144)<br /><br />“Most
          maroon leaders were Voodoo priests who saw themselves as prophets
          representing the loas [52]. Able to attract large followings, these
          charismatic leaders incited the enslaved to revolt by sabotaging
          plantation property and joining maroons [52]. In 1791, for instance,
          an entranced Voodoo priest informed the loas worshipers that the
          spirits wanted their assistance in liberating the enslaved [1]. The
          courage of Haitian liberators -attributable to their faith in the
          loas, their protectors [60, 68]- is evident in some of the songs they
          used to sing: We swear to destroy the whites And all that they
          possess; Let us die Rather than fail to keep this vow. [69] We can
          read this piece as a full unmasking of the more subtle song of the
          enslaved in North America: Before I’d be a slave I’ll be buried in my
          grave And go home to my Lord and be free.”(145)

          specific features. The following six main features might be found in
          any slave cult in colonial Haiti: 1. The belief in monotheism, that
          is, in a supreme being. 2. Spirit possession as the climax of every
          ceremony. 3. The centre post, sometimes a tree, through which occurs
          the mystical communication with the spirits …” (32)<br /><br />“These
          variables influenced in one way or another the formation of the
          various colonial Voodoo cults. No doubt by the time of the Haitian
          Revolution, these cults had fueled the political consciousness
          building and the rebellious spirit of the slaves. Colonists, as soon
          as they perceived the political role played by slave dances, outlawed
          them and prosecuted both those who allowed them and those who
          participated in them. 12 Voodoo cults became the first organized foci
          of open resistance to slavery. As Drouin de Bercy observes: ‘Don
          Pedro, like Voodoo, is a very dangerous secret society. The goal of
          its members is to kill or expel all the whites from the colony.
          Members never reveal the secrets of the group to non-initiates’ (cited
          in Paul 1962: 236). Colonial Voodoo was basically a plantation-based
          institution, except in the case of the maroons. There existed no
          Voodoo pope to regularize the colonial cult, to decide the orthodoxy
          of the doctrine or to standardize the ritual. While France was busying
          herself with war at horne, the Voodoo groups became cells of political
          organization for revolutionary blacks and mulattoes.” (33)<br /><br />“The
          slaves” religious traditions were the product of a slow and long
          process of Creolisation. Slaves were not acculturated to the European
          cultures as such, but to the emergent Creole culture (Laguerre 1970).
          The colonists themselves were also affected by this process of
          Creolisation.” (34)<br /><br />“Catholicism was perceived by some as
          the ‘magic of the whites’ (Laguerre 1969: 133). During the
          revolutionary wars for the liberation of the country, slaves had more
          confidence in the god of their ancestors, who protected their
          interests, than in the Catholic saints, who represented the interests
          of the colonists.” (36)

          “Haiti being thought of as but an interlude in a man’s life, the
          loosening of moral tone so complained of in contemporary works
          resulted, and with this went the many forms of display in which these
          colonists indulged and those other aspects of colonial custom which
          were so often ridiculed by European travelers of the period, the time
          which had elapsed since the French loss of Haiti, has, however, lent
          an enchantment to “Créole life” which is reflected in an idealized
          portrayal of this existence, much in the manner of the effusions on
          the graciousness and glamour of life in what is termed ‘the old
          South’.[23] One cannot read the extended narrative of the young Compte
          de C***, reprinted by de Vassière, without questioning the myth of the
          idyllic life of the Haitian Créole, even though allowing for the
          disdain with which an exiled Parisian dandy of 1730 would regard the
          inhabitants of outlying possessions, and allowing also for the savory
          wit of the man, which undoubtedly led him to underscore the more
          diverting situations which he encountered.[24] Mention must be made at
          this point of the two great divisions of the white population which,
          as the colonizing period continued, were created by the distinction
          between those born on the island and those who had migrated there.
          These divisions cut across the two categories of urban and country
          dwellers, both of which numbered Haitian-born and native European
          members. At the time fo the French Revolution about three quarters of
          the whites on the island had been born outside the colony, while of
          those born in the colony, women comprised the major proportion.[25]
          Haitian-born persons were known by the designation Créole, which,
          according to a definition of the period, included all those “who have
          first seen the light of day in Santo Domingo“ and was, as it is today,
          a term employed in all the West Indies and in Louisiana.[26] This
          designation was by no means restricted to the white, however, for
          there were Créole Negroes as well as Créole whites; at the present
          time in Haiti a distinction is even drawn between locally grown
          “créole” rice and that which is imported! It is common knowledge that
          slavery not only affects those who are held in bondage, but deeply
          influences the master-class as well. In Haiti the role played by the
          institution of slavery in the formation of the character and
          personalities of Créole children brought up in a setting of servility,
          cupiditiy, brutality, and terror must have been of the utmost
          importance. The bad temper and domineering nature of Créole youths is
          commented on again and again by writers of the period. Owing to the
          unhealthy climate and the failure to maintain adequate hygienic
          conditions, the health of these children was usually poor, so that
          from earliest infancy they were spoiled by their parents and servants;
          their least wishes were gratified, and their least complaints
          immediately rectified so as to make them petty tyrants in their
          households. This tyranny was most often exercised over the family
          slaves. Regardless of the assiduous care these young despots received,
          and despite the adulation lavished upon their young charges, the Negro
          servants were seldom sufficiently prompt or adequate in their
          attentiveness to escape the punishments, often severe, that were meted
          out to them at the behest of their young masters. This tyranny
          extended to the play-life of the young Haitian-born white. Surrounded
          only by the slave children of the plantation, he commanded his
          contemporaries even more imperiously than his parents commanded the
          grown slaves.
          <blockquote>
            Whatever he saw, he wanted, whatever was shown him he demanded; and
            if some fatality brought it about that one of his small companions
            resisted him and he became irritated, they would hurry from all
            sides in response to his cries and those of the young unfortunate,
            who, his color having destined him for submission, learned soon
            enough that he would be forced to give way, perhaps even being meted
            some punishment to penalize the disobedience of one who had not yet
            the instinct for servitude.[27]
          </blockquote>
          Grown to manhood, the young Créole continued to act as master of all
          he surveyed. Imperious, quick-tempered, spoiled, his life lived in
          large part among slaves, when his sex drive stirred, he took what
          slave women pleased him. Eventually he married, to be tormented with
          the thoughts of the possible infidelity of his wife; the more tortured
          because of his extreme vanity and because, while demanding
          faithfulness from his spouse, he was continuing his affairs with his
          Negro women. Yet he had some excellences of character, as well.
          ‘Frank, affable, generous perhaps to the point of ostentation,
          confident, brave, a sure friend and a good father’[28]--such are his
          good points as set down by one who was perhaps surer-eyed than others
          in seeing his deficiencies, though these traits seem to have concerned
          more his relations with his fellow-white than those which affected his
          bearing toward his Negro slaves.”
