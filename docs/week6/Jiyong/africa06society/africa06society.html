          <p><b>Aboltion of Slave Trade</b>
          </p>
          <p>(from:https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTimeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom&psig=AOvVaw2CKSf2Qfbpa9zIPSHKOlGI&ust=1633631442786000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCOCn1MK1tvMCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
          </p>
          <p>
            The humanity, justice, and magnanimity that have guided you in the
            reform of the most profoundly rooted abuses gives hope to the
            Society of the Friends of Blacks that you will receive with
            benevolence its demand in favor of that numerous portion of
            humankind, so cruelly oppressed for two centuries. 
          </p>
            This Society,
            slandered in such cowardly and unjust fashion, only derives its
            mission from the humanity that induced it to defend the blacks even
            under the past despotism. Oh! Can there be a more respectable title
            in the eyes of this august Assembly which has so often avenged the
            rights of man in its decrees? 
        </p> 
            <a>You</a> have declared them, these rights;
            you have engrave on an <a>immortal monument</a> that all men are
            born and remain free and equal in rights; you have restored to the
            French people these rights that despotism had for so long despoiled;
            . . . you have broken the chains of feudalism that still degraded a
            good number of our fellow citizens; you have announced the
            destruction of all the stigmatizing distinctions that religious or
            political prejudices introduced into the great family of humankind.
            . . . 
      </p>
            We are not asking you to restore to French those political
            rights which alone,nevertheless, attest to and maintain the dignity
            of man; we are not even asking for their liberty. . . . 
    </p>
            The
            immediate emancipation of the blacks would not only be a fatal
            operation for the colonies; it would even be a deadly gift for the
            blacks, in the state of <a>abjection and incompetence</a> to which cupidity
            has reduced them. It would be to abandon to themselves and without
            assistance children in the cradle or mutilated and impotent beings.
  </p>
            <a>It is therefore</a> not yet time to demand that liberty; we ask only
            that one cease butchering thousands of blacks regularly every year
            in order to take hundreds of captives; we ask that one henceforth
            cease the prostitution, the profaning of the French name, used to
            authorize these theft, these atrocious murders; we demand in a word
            the <a>abolition of the slave trade</a>. . . . 
</p>
            Some will tell you
            that the abolition of the <a>Slave Trade</a> will strike a most
            deadly blow to the Navy, to public tax revenues, to the Colonies,
            and to commerce.
</p>
            We will demonstrate to you that each year this
            commerce carries to the tomb half of the sailors who are condemned
            to work there; makes the other half physically and morally
            gangrenous, and infects with its contagion the remaining commerce.
</p>
            We will demonstrate to you that the Slave Trade is a burden weighing
            on the <a>public revenues</a>; that in order to support the slave trade,
            the State is obligated to maintain at great expense settlements in
            Africa; that it is again obliged to pay annually a subsidy of around
            2,500,000 livres and that this subsidy is triply deadly: in that it
            feeds a bloody commerce; in that the funds to supply this subsidy
            are raised on the fruit of the labor of the indigenous inhabitants
            of our countryside; and in that this subsidy, for the most part, is
            poured into the hands of English ship-owners, to whom the French
            merchants do not blush to lend their names in order to elude the
            intentions of the Government. . . . Is not the French slave trade in
            reality only a pretext to rob the State for the profit of
            foreigners. . .
          </p>
          <p>
            In regard to the colonists, we will demonstrate to you that if they
            need to recruit blacks in Africa to sustain the population of the
            colonies at the same level, it is because they wear out the blacks
            with work, whippings, and starvation; that, if they treated them
            with kindness and as good fathers of families, these blacks would
            multiply and that this population, always growing, would increase
            cultivation and prosperity. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Hey"
              >Hey! Do not step back from the duty that humanity imposes here
              upon you, for fear of some interruption in the minor work that the
              slave trade occasions in France? Did you heed this fear when with
              bold hand you overturned all the abuses which hindered a free
              Constitution?</a
            >
            These abuses, however, supported thousands of individuals; the
            commotion caused by this revolution threw all fortunes into
            incertitude, tightened all investment capital, suspended nearly all
            work. What evil citizen dares, however, complain of this necessary
            suspension! It is not, however, your blood that your tyrants shed;
            they do not violate constantly the haven of your house; they do not
            unjustly condemn you in order to have the right to sell you; they do
            not snatch you from your home to plunge you in eternal captivity in
            a foreign land. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            If some motive might on the contrary push them [the blacks] to
            insurrection, might it not be the indifference of the National
            Assembly about their lot? Might it not be the insistence on weighing
            them down with chains, when one consecrates everywhere this eternal
            axiom: that all men are born free and equal in rights. So then
            therefore there would only be fetters and gallows for the blacks
            while good fortune glimmers only for the whites? Have no doubt, our
            happy revolution must re-electrify the blacks whom vengeance and
            resentment have electrified for so long, and it is not with
            punishments that the effect of this upheaval will be repressed. From
            one insurrection badly pacified will twenty others be born, of which
            one alone can ruin the colonists forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worthy of the first free Assembly of France to consecrate the
            principle of philanthropy which makes of humankind only one single
            family, to declare that it is horrified by this annual carnage which
            takes place on the coasts of Africa, that it has the intention of
            abolishing it one day, of mitigating the slavery that is the result,
            of looking for and preparing, from this moment, the means.

They opposed slavery, which was institutionalized in the French colonies of the Caribbean and North America, and the African slave trade. The Society was created in Paris in 1788, and operated until 1793, during years of the French Revolution. It was led by Jacques Pierre Brissot, with advice from British Thomas Clarkson, who led the abolitionist movement in the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the beginning of 1789, the Society had 141 members.<br/><br/>During the five-year period that it operated, it published anti-slavery literature and frequently addressed its concerns on a substantive political level in the National Assembly of France. In February 1794, the National Assembly passed the Universal Emancipation decree, which effectively freed all colonial slaves and gave them equal rights. This decision was later reversed under Napoleon, who tried unsuccessfully to reinstitute slavery in the colonies and to regain control of Saint-Domingue, where a slave rebellion was underway.<br/><br/>Several articles and monographs have explored the question of how influential the Society was in bringing about the abolition of slavery. Historians disagree about their influence, with some crediting the <i>Amis des Noirs</i> as instrumental in abolition, to others who say the Society was nothing more than a "société de pensée" (philosophical society).

            <b>Race and sympathy: the trope of the pleading slave</b><br/><br/>It was against this backdrop of racial indeterminacy, violence, and terror in the colonies that the best-known abolitionist image appeared first in England in 1787 in the form of a silhouette of a chained black slave pleading for recognition of his humanity; his face in profile looks upward toward the caption, "Am I Not a Man and a Brother?" The kneeing slave became the most ubiquitous symbol of the abolitionist cause, inspiring pity among white European viewers at the sight of the imploring, half-clothed figure asking only to be recognized as a fellow human. Designed by William Hackwood as the official seal of the London Committee for the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, it was made by Josiah Wedgewood into small black and white jasperware medallions. <b>[28]</b> The emblem quickly became the official symbol of the French abolitionist group, the Société des Amis des Noirs, with the shortened title, "Ne suis-je pas ton frere?" (Am I not your brother?)<br/><br/>The Société des Amis des Noirs was founded in 1788 by Jacques-Pierre Brissot de Warville. Other members included Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, and other prominent men of the French elite, including the marquis de Lafayette. Henri (Abbé) Grégoire, the marquis de Condorcet, and Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès. <b>[29]</b> Committed to a "politics of pity," the members were primarily devoted to the abolition of slave trade, not to ending slavery, and to the "softening" of colonists’ treatment of their slaves, as outlined in their 1790 <i>Adresse à l’Assemblé Nationale pour l’abolition de la traite des noirs par la Société des Amis des Noirs</i> (Address to the National Assembly for the abolition of the slave trade by the Société des Amis des Noirs). <b>[30]</b> Much of their other writing employed familiar tropes of blackness, employed as reasons to gradually abolish slavery. In fact, in what Laurent Dubois terms "republican racism," many arguments in favor of abolition were identical to those of pro-slavery groups making a case for Africans’ natural suitability for slavery. <b>[31]</b> For example, in reference to perceptions of life in Africa, what opponents of slavery would call "innocent" or "unspoiled," supporters of slavery might term "stupid" or "uncivilized ." Believing that the temperament of slaves was "sweet, confiding, and timid," the Société advocated the creation of colonies in Africa as a means for ending the slave trade. They did not, however, support the immediate abolition of slavery, arguing that the slaves were not yet ready. <b>[32]</b> Mirabeau’s 1757 <i>L’ami des hommes, ou Traité de la population</i> (The friend of man, or The peoples’ treatise) argued forcefully against the African slave trade and slavery as it was practiced in the Americas. However, this was not because he viewed Africans as equal to Europeans; in fact he claimed that "our slaves in America are a race of men separate and distinct from our own species by the most indelible of traits, that of color," further referring to Africans as "brutish or endowed with an instinct that is foreign to us." <b>[33]</b> ln his <i>Réflexsions sur l’esclavage ...</i> (Reflections on slavery ... ) Condorcet noted what he saw as the slaves’ "stupidity," but blamed it on the condition of slavery: <blockquote>If, because of their lack of education and the stupidity contracted through slavery by the corruption ot their morals . .. the slaves of the European oolonies have become incapable of fulfilling the duties of free men, we can ... treat them as men who have been deprived by misery or sickness of a portion of their faculties. We cannot, therefore, grant them the full exercise of their rights without exposing them to the risk of hurting others or harming themselves. <b>[34]</b></blockquote>It is not surprising, therefore, that the imploring slave motif would be appealing as a visual means of persuading a reluctant French public that black slaves should be better treated and that their trade should end.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>28 Sam Margolin, "‘And Freedom to the Slave’: Antislavery Ceramics, 1787-1865," <i>Ceramics in America 2002</i> (Hanover, NH and London: Chipstone Foundation, distributed by University Press of New England, 2002), 81.<br/><br/>29 Daniel P.
