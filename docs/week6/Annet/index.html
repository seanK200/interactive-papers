          <p>
            The study of natural history is simple, beautiful, and instructive
            in the collection, arrangement, and <a>exhibition</a> of the various
            productions of the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            These are divided into the three grand kingdoms of nature, whose
            boundaries meet together in the Zoophytes.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Minerals inhabit the interior parts of the earth in rude and
            shapeless masses; are generated by salts, mixed together
            promiscuously and shaped fortuitously.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            They are bodies concrete, without life or sensation.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Vegetables clothe the surface with verdure, imbibe nourishment
            through bibulous roots, breathe by quivering leaves, celebrate their
            nuptials in a genial metamorphosis, and continue their kind by the
            dispersion of seed within prescribed limits.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <div>They are bodies organized, and have life and not sensation.</div>
        </p>
          <p>
          </p>
            <p>
            Animals adorn the exterior parts of the earth, respire, and generate
            eggs; are impelled to action by hunger, congeneric affections, and
            pain; and by preying on other animals and vegetables, <a>restrain with
            proper proportion the numbers of both. </a>
            </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            They are bodies organized, and have life, sensation, and the power
            of locomotion. <a>Man, the last and best of created works, formed after
            the image of his Maker, endowed with a portion of intellectual
            divinity, the governor and subjugator of all other beings</a>, is, by
            his wisdom alone, able to form just conclusions from such things as
            present themselves to his senses, which can only consist of bodies
            merely natural. Hence the first step of wisdom is to know these
            bodies; and to be able, by those marks imprinted on them by nature,
            to distinguish them from each other, and to affix to every object
            its proper name.
          </p>
        </p>
          <p>
            These are the elements of all sciences; this is the great alphabet
            of nature: <a>for if the name be lost, the knowledge of the object is
            lost also</a>; and without these, the student will seek in vain for the
            means to investigate the hidden treasures of nature.
          </p>
