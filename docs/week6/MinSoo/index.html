            In regard to the colonists, we will demonstrate to you that if they
            need to recruit blacks in Africa to sustain the population of the
            colonies at the same level, it is because they wear out the blacks
            with work, whippings, and starvation; that, if they treated them
            with kindness and as good fathers of families, these blacks would
            multiply and that this population, always growing, would increase
            cultivation and prosperity. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Hey"
              >Hey! Do not step back from the duty that humanity imposes here
              upon you, for fear of some interruption in the minor work that the
              slave trade occasions in France? Did you heed this fear when with
              bold hand you overturned all the abuses which hindered a free
              Constitution?</a
            >
            These abuses, however, supported thousands of individuals; the
            commotion caused by this revolution threw all fortunes into
            incertitude, tightened all investment capital, suspended nearly all
            work. What evil citizen dares, however, complain of this necessary
            suspension! It is not, however, your blood that your tyrants shed;
            they do not violate constantly the haven of your house; they do not
            unjustly condemn you in order to have the right to sell you; they do
            not snatch you from your home to plunge you in eternal captivity in
            a foreign land. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            If some motive might on the contrary push them [the blacks] to
            insurrection, might it not be the indifference of the National
            Assembly about their lot? Might it not be the insistence on weighing
            them down with chains, when one consecrates everywhere this eternal
            axiom: that all men are born free and equal in rights. So then
            therefore there would only be fetters and gallows for the blacks
            while good fortune glimmers only for the whites? Have no doubt, our
            happy revolution must re-electrify the blacks whom vengeance and
            resentment have electrified for so long, and it is not with
            punishments that the effect of this upheaval will be repressed. From
            one insurrection badly pacified will twenty others be born, of which
            one alone can ruin the colonists forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worthy of the first free Assembly of France to consecrate the
            principle of philanthropy which makes of humankind only one single
            family, to declare that it is horrified by this annual carnage which
            takes place on the coasts of Africa, that it has the intention of
            abolishing it one day, of mitigating the slavery that is the result,
            of looking for and preparing, from this moment, the means.
