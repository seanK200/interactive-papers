            <a>David Hume</a>, “Of National Characters” (1748, 1754 and 1776), General
            and Particular (multivolume <a>work</a> published between 1748-1808); from
            Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ed., Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader
            (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2007), 32-33.
          </h3>
          <p>
            … are <a>fitted to live</a> in all climates, such as dogs, horses,
            etc. do not attain the same perfection in all. The courage of
            bull-dogs and game-cocks seems peculiar to England. <a>Flanders</a> is
            remarkable for large and heavy horses, Spain for horses light, and
            of good mettle. Any breed of these creatures, transplanted from one
            country to another, will soon lose the qualities, which they derived
            from their native climate. It may be asked, why not the same with
            men? <p>There are few questions more curious than this, or which will
            more often occur in our inquiries concerning human affairs; and
            therefore it may be proper to give it a full examination.</p>
            <a>The human mind is of a very imitative nature</a>; nor is it
            possible for any set of men to converse often together, without
            acquiring a similitude of manners and communicating to each other
            their vices as well as virtues. The propensity to company and
            society is strong in all rational creatures; and the same
            disposition, which gives us this propensity, makes us enter deeply
            into each other’s sentiments, and causes like passions and
            inclinations to run, as it were, by contagion, through that whole
            club or knot of companions. Where a number of men are united into
            one political body the occasions of their intercourse must be so
            frequent, for defense, commerce and government, that, together with
            the same speech or language, they must acquire a resemblance in
            their manners, and have a common or national character, as well as a
            personal one, peculiar to each individual. Now though nature
            produces all kinds of temper and understanding in great abundance,
            it does not follow, that <a>she</a> always produces them in like
            proportions and that in every society the ingredients of industry
            and indolence, valour and cowardice, humanity and brutality, wisdom
            and folly, will be mixed after the same manner. In the infancy of
            society, if any of these dispositions be found in greater abundance
            than the rest, it will naturally prevail in the compositions and
            give a tincture to the national character ...
