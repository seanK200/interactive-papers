          <h2>Letter to General Etienne Laveaux, May 1794</h2>
          <p>
            It is very true, general, that I was led into error by the enemies
            of the Republic [of France] and of mankind, but who is the man who
            can hope to avoid all the traps of the wicked ? Indeed, I fell into
            their nets, but not without reason . . . the Spanish offered me
            their protection, and freedom for all those who fought for the
            kings’ cause; and having always fought to possess this same freedom,
            I clung to their offer, seeing myself abandoned by the French, my
            brothers. But an experience a little later opened my eyes to these
            treacherous protectors; and being aware of their deceipt and
            villainy, I saw clearly that their intentions were to make us cut
            each other’s throats in order to reduce our numbers and oppress
            those remaining in chains and cause them to sink back into their
            former slavery. No, they never would reach their base goal! And in
            our turn we will avenge ourselves of those wretched beings in every
            respect. Thus let us unite forever and, forgetting the past,
            henceforth concern ourselves only with crushing our enemies...
          </p>
          <h2>Letter to the People of Verrettes, March 1795</h2>
          <p>
            Brothers and sisters, The moment has arrived when the thick veil
            that was blocking the light must fall. One must no longer forget the
            decrees of the National Convention. Its principles, its love of
            liberty, are unchanging, and henceforth, there can be no hope of
            this sacred edifice crumbling. . .
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learned with infinite joy about the return of some citizens
            of Verrettes to the bosom of the Republic; they will find the
            happiness that eluded them at the instigation of the soldiers of
            tyranny and royalty. . . . To give them help, console them regarding
            past faults and prompt them to abjure the errors in which they were
            insidiously nourished, is an absolute duty and the sacred maxim of
            the French for all republicans.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why not only by virtue of the powers entrusted by General
            Laveaux, but also animated \ by the feelings of humanity and
            brotherhood with which I am filled, I must remind the citizens of
            Verrettes of their errors; but as much as they are detrimental to
            the interests of the Republic, as much I feel that their return,
            sincere, can be advantageous to the growth of our success. . .
          </p>
          <p>
            The French are our brothers; the English, the Spanish, and royalists
            are ferocious beasts who caress them only in order to suck their
            blood, that of their wives, and of their children at leisure, until
            satiation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Citizens, I am not searching here to make a show of your faults...
            You have returned to the bosom of the Republic, and well! Since then
            the past is forgotten; your duty is now to unite all of your
            physical and moral means to revive your parish and let the
            principles of sacred liberty germinate.
          </p>
