          <p><b>Aboltion of Slave Trade</b>
          </p>
          <p>(from:https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTimeline_of_abolition_of_slavery_and_serfdom&psig=AOvVaw2CKSf2Qfbpa9zIPSHKOlGI&ust=1633631442786000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCOCn1MK1tvMCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
          </p>
          <p>
            The humanity, justice, and magnanimity that have guided you in the
            reform of the most profoundly rooted abuses gives hope to the
            Society of the Friends of Blacks that you will receive with
            benevolence its demand in favor of that numerous portion of
            humankind, so cruelly oppressed for two centuries. 
          </p>
            This Society,
            slandered in such cowardly and unjust fashion, only derives its
            mission from the humanity that induced it to defend the blacks even
            under the past despotism. Oh! Can there be a more respectable title
            in the eyes of this august Assembly which has so often avenged the
            rights of man in its decrees? 
        </p> 
            <a>You</a> have declared them, these rights;
            you have engrave on an <a>immortal monument</a> that all men are
            born and remain free and equal in rights; you have restored to the
            French people these rights that despotism had for so long despoiled;
            . . . you have broken the chains of feudalism that still degraded a
            good number of our fellow citizens; you have announced the
            destruction of all the stigmatizing distinctions that religious or
            political prejudices introduced into the great family of humankind.
            . . . 
      </p>
            We are not asking you to restore to French those political
            rights which alone,nevertheless, attest to and maintain the dignity
            of man; we are not even asking for their liberty. . . . 
    </p>
            The
            immediate emancipation of the blacks would not only be a fatal
            operation for the colonies; it would even be a deadly gift for the
            blacks, in the state of <a>abjection and incompetence</a> to which cupidity
            has reduced them. It would be to abandon to themselves and without
            assistance children in the cradle or mutilated and impotent beings.
  </p>
            <a>It is therefore</a> not yet time to demand that liberty; we ask only
            that one cease butchering thousands of blacks regularly every year
            in order to take hundreds of captives; we ask that one henceforth
            cease the prostitution, the profaning of the French name, used to
            authorize these theft, these atrocious murders; we demand in a word
            the <a>abolition of the slave trade</a>. . . . 
</p>
            Some will tell you
            that the abolition of the <a>Slave Trade</a> will strike a most
            deadly blow to the Navy, to public tax revenues, to the Colonies,
            and to commerce.
</p>
            We will demonstrate to you that each year this
            commerce carries to the tomb half of the sailors who are condemned
            to work there; makes the other half physically and morally
            gangrenous, and infects with its contagion the remaining commerce.
</p>
            We will demonstrate to you that the Slave Trade is a burden weighing
            on the <a>public revenues</a>; that in order to support the slave trade,
            the State is obligated to maintain at great expense settlements in
            Africa; that it is again obliged to pay annually a subsidy of around
            2,500,000 livres and that this subsidy is triply deadly: in that it
            feeds a bloody commerce; in that the funds to supply this subsidy
            are raised on the fruit of the labor of the indigenous inhabitants
            of our countryside; and in that this subsidy, for the most part, is
            poured into the hands of English ship-owners, to whom the French
            merchants do not blush to lend their names in order to elude the
            intentions of the Government. . . . Is not the French slave trade in
            reality only a pretext to rob the State for the profit of
            foreigners. . .
