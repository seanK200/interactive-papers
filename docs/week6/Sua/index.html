              <h5>Anonymous [a 15-16 year-old son of French planters in St. Domingue], My Odyssey (1793), from Althea de Puech Partham, ed., and trans., <a data-ip-footnote-id="odyssey">My Odyssey: Experiences of a Young Refugee from Two Revolutions</a> (Louisiana State University Press, 1959), 23-25, 27-28, 31-34, reprinted in Richard Lim and David Kammerling Smith, eds., The West in the Wider World (New York: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003), 150-152.</h5>
              <br />
            [The following day, the author joins a small contingent of French
            militia troops.]<br /><br />
            We were sitting down to dinner when
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="signal"
              >we saw their [the rebel slaves] signal, which is always the
              burning of some stalks of sugar-cane</a
            >. Our general, a man of appetite as well as of combat, decided we
            should continue with our repast, and after giving several orders for
            the safety of our quarters, sat down to dinner. We were eating
            heartily until the moment a cannonball passed through the window and
            carried away, right under our beards, the table and all the plates.
            The general, infuriated by this mishap, mounted his horse with food
            still in his mouth, and left camp with six hundred men and four
            pieces of artillery. Two hours later one could not find a living
            Negro within a circle of two and a half miles, and the roads were
            strewn with their bloody remains. . . . <br /><br />
            I pursued a Negro whose regalia caused me to judge him to be one of
            the principal chiefs. As I was about to overtake him, he turned
            around, took aim, but happily for me, could not make his powder fire
            as it was too damp. I prepared myself to cleave his head with my
            sword, whereupon he fell to his knees, kissed my boots, and told me,
            with tears in his eyes, that he was my Mother’s godson, that he was
            present at my birth, and carried me in his arms more than once, and
            beseeched me not to kill him; that he was a good Negro and that he
            had always loved the Whites. His manner disarmed me; I dismounted
            from my horse before having him conducted to camp. However, a soft
            sound made me quickly turn my head, and I saw the miserable
            hypocrite, who had recharged his gun, aiming point-blank at my head;
            being troubled at finding himself discovered, prevented him from
            aiming accurately, and the bullet went past me. I fell upon him but
            he was on guard for my attack; and there we were both acting as if
            playing Prisoner’s Base. I caught my runner at the moment when he
            was about to slash me and threw him into some weeds. Even then he
            had the impudence to maintain that I had not seen correctly , and
            that he loved the son of his godmother too much to try to kill him.
            When he heard himself convicted by a number of soldiers who had just
            arrived and had witnessed the incident, he changed his tune and told
            me in his jargon: “Master, I know that is true. It is the Devil who
            gets inside of this body of mine. I am a good nigger, but against my
            will the Devil is too strong.” His excuse made me laugh despite my
            anger, and had I been alone,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="certainly"
              >I would certainly have saved him; but the soldiers seized him and
              bound him to a tree to be shot.</a
            >
            When he saw that his fate was sealed, he began to laugh, sing, and
            joke. At times, however, reviling us in a furious tone, at times
            jeering at us in mockery. He gave the signal himself and met death
            without fear or complaint. We found in one of his pockets pamphlets
            printed in France, filled with commonplaces about the Rights of Man
            and the Sacred [French] Revolution; in his vest was a large packet
            of tinder and phosphate of lime. On his chest he had a little sack
            full of hair, herbs, bits of bone, which they call a fetish; with
            this, they expect to be sheltered from all danger; and it was, no
            doubt, because of this amulet, that our man had the intrepidity
            which the philosophers call Stoicism.
