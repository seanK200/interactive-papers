          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The representatives of the French people, organized as a National
              Assembly, believing that the ignorance, neglect or contempt of the
              rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities and of the
              corruption of governments, have determined to set forth in a
              solemn declaration the natural, inalienable, and sacred rights of
              man, in order that this declaration, being constantly before
              <a data-ip-footnote-id="[M]">
                all the members of the social body </a
              >, shall remind them continually of their rights and duties; in
              order that the acts of the legislative power, as well as those of
              the executive power, may be compared at any moment with the
              objects and purposes of all political institutions and may thus be
              more respected; and, lastly, in order that the grievances of the
              citizens, based hereafter upon simple and incontestable
              principles, shall tend to the maintenance of the constitution and
              redound to the happiness of all. Therefore the National Assembly
              recognizes and proclaims, in the presence and under the auspices
              of the Supreme Being, the following rights of man and of the
              citizen:
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Article 1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social
            distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the
            natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty,
            property, security, and resistance of oppression.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the
            nation.<a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]">
              No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not
              proceed directly from the nation.</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no
            one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has
            no limits except those which assure to the other members of the
            society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be
            determined by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society.
            Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one
            may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a
            right to participate personally, or through his representative, in
            its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or
            punishes. <a data-ip-footnote-id="[4]">All citizens</a>, being equal
            in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to
            all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities,
            and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents.
          </p>

          <p>
            7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the
            cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one
            soliciting, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed, any
            arbitrary order, shall be punished. But any citizen summoned or
            arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without delay, as
            resistance constitutes an offense.
          </p>

          <p>
            8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly
            and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except
            it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated
            before the commission of the offense.
          </p>

          <p>
            9. As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been
            declared guilty, if arrest be deemed indispensable, all harshness
            not essential to the securing of the prisonerâ€™s person shall be
            severly repressed by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including
            his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb
            the public order established by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most
            precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly,
            speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for
            such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires
            public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for
            the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom
            they shall be intrusted.
          </p>

          <p>
            13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the
            public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be
            equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their
            means.
          </p>

          <p>
            14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by
            their representatives, as to the necessity of the public
            contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put;
            and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection
            and the duration of the taxes.
          </p>

          15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account
          of his administrations. 16. A society in which the observance of the
          law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no
          constitution at all. 17. Since property is an inviolable and sacred
          right, no one shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity,
          legally determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on
          condition that the owner shall have been previously and equitably
          indemnified.

          <b>  (ST)</b> while the author(s) write of equality, their language excludes
            women and other races implicitly from that equality. At this time, I
            believe citizens were white male nationals only, and so the word
            "all"-- which is meant to express equality-- only covers some of the
            population.
