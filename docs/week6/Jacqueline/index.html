              ><a>David Hume</a>, “Of National Characters” (1748, 1754 and 1776), General and Particular (multivolume
              work published between 1748-1808); from Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ed., Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader
              (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2007), 32-33.</b

          </h3>
          <p>
            If the <a>characters of men</a> depended on the air and climate, the degrees of heat and cold should
            naturally be expected to have a mighty influence;
            <a>since nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational animals.</a>
            And indeed there is some reason to think, that all the nations, which live beyond the polar circles or
            between the tropics, are inferior to the rest of the species, and are
            <a>incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind.</a>
            The poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and the indolence of the southern from
            their few necessities, may, perhaps, account for this remarkable difference, without our having recourse to
            physical causes. This however is certain, that the characters of nations are very promiscuous in the
            temperate climates, and that almost all the general observations, which have been formed of the more
            southern or more northern people in these climates, are found to be uncertain and fallacious. [In a
            footnote:] I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general
            <a
              >all other species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the
              whites.</a
            >
            <a
              >There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent
              either in action or speculation.</a
            >
            No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences. On the other hand, the most rude and barbarous
            of the whites, such as the ancient Germans, the present Tartars, have still something eminent about them, in
            their valour, form of government, or some other particular. Such a uniform and constant difference could not
            happen, in so many countries and ages
            <a>if nature had not made an original distinction between these breeds of men.</a>
            Not to mention our colonies, there are negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of whom none ever discovered
            any symptoms of ingenuity; though low people without education will start up amongst us and distinguish
            themselves in every profession. In
            <a>Jamaica, indeed,</a> they talk of one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but it is likely he is
            admired for slender accomplishments, <a>like a parrot</a> who speaks a few words plainly (end of footnote]…
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord BACON has observed, that the
            <a>inhabitants of the south are, in general, more ingenious than those of the north</a>; but that, where the
            native of a cold climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits.
            This observation a later writer confirms, by comparing the southern wits to cucumbers, which are commonly
            all good in their kind; but at best are an insipid fruit; while the northern geniuses are like melons, of
            which not one in fifty is good; but when it is so, it has an exquisite relish. I believe this remark may be
            allowed just, when confined to the European nations…
