          <p>
            How often, from what I have seen, have I been able to recognize the
            injustice of those written diatribes, that were flooding Europe,
            against the poor planters of Saint Domingue! What lies! What
            exaggerated pictures! What ignorance of the country, the customs,
            the habits, and the laws. During the past months, between the
            different revolts and insurrections, I have seen everywhere Negroes
            who were <a>fat, well cared for, and happy.</a> I have seen them
            many times, about a <a>hundred of them</a> occupied with work that
            twenty Europeans could achieve in much less time. Their cabins
            appeared sanitary, commodious, and furnished with the necessary
            utensils for their needs. These cabins were surrounded with land
            where they raised pigs and a variety of fowl; they had me observe
            their individual gardens, which were perfectly tended and abundantly
            planted with all the necessary products of our country. I noticed
            that the hospital was the finest edifice of each plantation. I was
            told that a doctor visited them each day and that women looked after
            the sick. Other women had the care of the children, to bathe, comb,
            etc. each morning. I often found idle groups, and was told that
            these were convalescents, nursing mothers, pregnant women, and old
            people, who were exempt from service. . . . For those who question
            the discipline under which they live, it is certainly not more
            rigorous than that which is observed for soldiers and sailors; and
            when one realizes that thirty thousand whites are in the center of
            six hundred thousand <a>semibarbaric</a> Africans, one should not
            hesitate to say that discipline is necessary. The young adult
            Negroes of our plantation, informed of our return, gathered in a
            crowd before us, and by a thousand bizarre demonstrations testified
            to the joy they had in seeing us. . . . My voyage has offered you
            nothing so far but about agreeable happenings to me; but, Oh, my
            friend, what a cruel account I must now make to you! The day after
            my arrival, while partaking with my family of the pleasures of an
            excellent lunch, a courier arrived to deliver to my step-father,
            commander of the district in which our property is located, a letter
            full of the most terrifying news. The slaves, enflamed by emissaries
            sent from France, had burned the habitations of our neighbors near
            the Cape, after assassinating the proprietors without distinction of
            age or sex. Already the insurrection was causing devastation on all
            sides, and they feared it would soon reach our place of habitation.
            The report of this terrific catastrophe was widely spread. The
            frightened families among our neighbors met together at our
            plantation. The men armed to face the storm; the mothers, wives,
            sisters were lamenting and gathering in all haste a few precious
            effects. Desolation and fear were painted on all faces. The sky
            seemed on fire. Guns could be heard from afar and the bells of the
            plantations were sounding the alarm. The danger increased. The
            flames at each moment were approaching the enclosing about us. There
            was no time to lose; we fled. The victims who escaped at swordâ€™s
            point came to swell the number of fugitives, and recounted to us the
            horrors which they had witnessed. They had seen unbelievable
            tortures to which they testified. Many women, young, beautiful, and
            virtuous, perished beneath the infamous caresses of the brigands,
            amongst the cadavers of their fathers and husbands. Bodies, still
            palpitating, were dragged through the roads with atrocious
            acclamation. Young children transfixed upon the points of bayonets
            were the bleeding flags which followed the troop of cannibals. . . .

          (AUTH) The author either tries to downplay the torture that the slaves
          experience in their daily lives, or he has this opinion and doesn't
          know it better

          (Q) The word "barbaric" was used in multiple instances to describe
          Africans. On the other hand, these texts associate words such as art,
          writing, fair, sanguine, and brawn with Europeans. What is it Africans
          that are so barbaric to Europeans, and what about barbarism do
          Europeans find so revolting? Are such ideals aftermath of the
          Europeans' pride in a civilized nation?
