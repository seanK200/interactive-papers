            <b><i>Opinions on the origin of blackness</i></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people imagine that Ham is the father of the Moors and that God
            made him black as a punishment which now all his descendants have
            inherited. However, one can provide no proof as to why the color
            black should be the mark of a curse in a more fitting fashion than
            the color white.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many physicians believe that the color black comes from the
            epidermis and the black substance of which it is stained. Still
            others trace it to the reticular membrane. Because the color of
            humans goes through all the shades of yellow, brown and dark brown
            until it becomes black in the hot parts of the earth, it is clear
            that the reason for it is the hot climate. However, it is certain
            that a great number of generations has been needed for it to become
            part of the species and hereditary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that the drying up [by the hot sun] of the vessels that
            carry the blood and serum under the skin brings about the lack of a
            beard and the short curly hair. Likewise, because the sunlight that
            falls through the surface skin into the dried up vessels eats up the
            reticular membrane, there arises the appearance of a black color.
          </p>
          <p>
            How such a coincidental thing as color could, however, become part
            of a species cannot be explained so easily. But one sees from other
            examples that this is the situation in other parts of nature. The
            reason why some hens become quite white in color can be explained by
            the difference in food, air and the way in which they are raised;
            and if one chooses only the white chicks from the many chicks that
            come from one set of parents and puts them together, one finally
            achieves a white race -a result which does not easily turn out
            differently. Is this not the way that English and Arabian or Spanish
            horses raised on dry land generate themselves, so that they finally
            create foals of a quite different build? All dogs that are brought
            from Europe to Africa become dumb and bald and produce only similar
            offspring thereafter. Similar changes occur with sheep, cows and
            other species of animal. The fact that Moors occasionally have a
            white child happens for the same reason that, now and again, there
            appears a white raven, a white crow or blackbird.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that it is the heat of the area- rather than a particular
            set of parents- that causes blackness can be seen by the fact that
            in the same country [Africa] those that live in the flat parts are
            far blacker than those who live in the high altitudes. That is why
            the blacker people live in Senegal than in Congo, and blacker people
            live in Angola than in Upper Ethiopia or in Abyssinia.

            All oriental nations that lie towards the East on the meridian of
            Bengal have something of the Kalmucks or Tartars about them. They
            are made in the following way: a face that is wide on top and narrow
            and flat below, amost no protruding nose, very small eyes, very
            thick eyebrows, black hair, thin and sparse tufts of hear instead of
            a beard and short legs with fat calves. Shaped in this manner are
            the eastern Tartars, the Chinese, the Arak, the Siamese, the
            Japanese, etc., although they all make themselves more beautiful on
            occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whithout taking notice notice of the superstitioous opinions about
            the origins of certain forms [Bildungen] one can make only the
            following remark with certainty: namely, that in this area of
            Melkapur on the Coromandel coast, there are many people with very
            fat legs. A few sensible travelers trace the fat legs to the
            constitution of the water, in the same way as goiters in the Tyrol
            and Salzburg are similarly supposed to stem from the water, which
            contains sinter. The giants of Patagonia are, at least as a people
            of giants, fictitious. The same fictitious origin could be ascribed
            to the people with raw and huge lips that are supposed to live in
            Senegal, who hold a cloth in front of the mouth and communicate
            without speech. The people Plinius spoke of, the one-eyed, bumpy,
            one-footed people without a mouth, dwarves and the like, also belong
            to this category.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inhabitants of the coast of New Holland have half-closed eyes
            and cannot see into the distance without tilting their heads right
            back. They accustom themselves to this because of the many
            mosquitoes that are always flying into their eyes. Some peoples,
            like the Moors of Sierra Leone and the Mongols who are within the
            area of China, spread an evil smell. Among the Hottentots, as Kolbe
            reports, many women develop a piece of leather on their pubic bone
            which partially covers their reproductive organs, and which they are
            supposed to cut off from time to time. Ludolph reports the same of
            many Egyptian (Ethiopian) women. (See Le Vaillant's Travels.) The
            people on Formosa, in the interior of Borneo etc., who possess the
            beginnings of an ape's tail ... seem to be not completely
            fictitious.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the hot countries the human being matures in all aspects earlier,
            but does not, however, reach the perfection of those in the
            temperate zones. Humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race
            of the whites. The yellow Indians do have a meagre talent. The
            Negroes are far below them and at the lowest point are a part of the
            American peoples.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moors and the other peoples between the tropics of Cancer and
            Capricorn can run quite astonishingly. They as well as other savages
            have more strength than the other civilized peoples, which stems
            from the free movement allowed them in their childhood. The
            Hottentots can perceive a ship with the naked eye at the same
            distance as a European can with a telescope. The women in the
            hottest parts of the world already produce children at the age of 9
            or 10 and finish before they are 25 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don Ulloa remarks that in Cartagena in America and in the
            surrounding areas people become clever very early but they do not
            continue to grow in intelligence at the same rate. All inhabitants
            of the hottest zones are exceptionally lethargic. With so this
            laziness is somewhat mitigated by rule and force.
          </p>

            When an Indian sees a European going somewhere, he thinks that he
            has something to accomplish. When he comes back, he thinks that he
            has already taken care of his business, but if he sees him going out
            a third time he thinks that he has lost his mind, as the European is
            going for a walk for pleasure, which no Indian does; he is only
            capable of imagining it. Indians are also indecisive, and both
            traits belong to the nations that live very far north. The weakening
            of their limbs is supposedly caused by brandy, tobacco, opium and
            other strong things. From their timidity comes superstition,
            particularly in regard to magic, and the same with jealousy. Their
            timidity makes them into slavish underlings when they have kings and
            evokes an idolatrous reverence in them, just as their laziness moves
            them rather to run around in the forest and suffer need than to be
            held to their labors by the orders of their masters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Montesquieu is correct in his judgment that the weak-heartedness
            that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the Negro also makes
            him fear many things other than death that the European can
            withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns himself if he is to be
            forced into slavery. The Indian women burn themselves. The Carib
            commits suicide at the slightest provocation. The Peruvian trembles
            in the face of an enemy, and when he is led to death, he is
            ambivalent, as though it means nothing. His awakened imagination,
            however, also makes him dare to do something but the heat of the
            moment is soon past and timidity resumes its old place again…

            The inhabitant of the temperate parts of the world, above all the
            central part, has a more beautiful body, works harder, is more
            jocular, more controlled in his passions, more intelligent than any
            other race of people in the world. That is why at all points in time
            these peoples have educated the others and controlled them with
            weapons.
