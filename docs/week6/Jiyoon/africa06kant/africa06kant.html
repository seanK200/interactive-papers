            “On the Different Races of Men”</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the most intelligible case of all, namely the derivation of
            the Americans, as the not completely adapted race of people which
            has long inhabited the northernmost region of the world, will be
            well confirmed by the suppressed growth of hair on all parts of the
            body except the head, by the reddish, rusty color characteristic of
            the colder tern tones and the darker copper color of the hotter ones
            of this continent. For the red-brown appears to be suited (an effect
            of the atmospheric acids) as well to the cold climate as olive-brown
            (as an effect of the alkaline-bilious condition of the juices) to
            the hot; to say nothing of the temperament of the Americans; which
            temperament betrays a half-extinguished body-force, which can most
            naturally be looked upon as the effect of a cold world-region.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the extreme <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]"
            >damp heat of the warm climate</a> must show,
            upon a people that has aged in it sufficiently to have become fully
            adapted to its soil, effects that are quite the opposite of the
            former. It is precisely the opposite appearance from the Kalmuck
            formation that is engendered. The growth of the spongy parts of the
            body must increase in a hot, moist climate; hence a thick snub-nose
            and tumid lips. The skin must be oily, not only to moderate the
            influence of evaporation but also to prevent the injurious
            absorption of the <a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]"
            >noxious vapors</a> of the air the superabundance of
            the iron particles, which are present in all human blood, and which
            are precipitated in the reticular substance through evaporation of
            the acids of phosphorus (which make all Negroes stink) cause the
            blackness that shines through the <a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]"
            >superficial skin</a>; and the high
            iron content of the blood seems also necessary in order to forestall
            a slackening of all parts. The oil of the skin which weakens the
            nutrient mucus that is requisite for hair growth has permitted
            hardly even the production of a woolly covering for the head.
            Besides all this, damp heat promotes strong growth in animals in
            general; in short, the Negro is produced, well suited to his
            climate; that is, strong, fleshy, supple, but in the midst of the
            bountiful provision of his motherland lazy, soft and dawdling.</p> <p>The
            native of Hindustan may be looked upon as having sprung from one of
            the oldest human races. His country, braced to the north against a
            high mountain range and from north to south to the tip of the
            peninsula traversed by a long mountain chain (to which I count also
            Tibet in the north which perhaps was the common place of refuge for
            mankind and his stock of vegetation after the last great revolution
            of our earth), has in an equable atmosphere the most perfect
            drainage-divide, such as is possessed by no other part of the
            Asiatic mainland situated in an equable climate. It therefore has
            been dry and habitable even in the most ancient times, since both
            the eastern peninsula of India and China must have been still
            uninhabited in those times of floods (for in them the rivers,
            instead of being divided, run parallel). Here then it was possible
            for a firm human race to take its foundation over a long period of
            time. The olive-yellow of the Indian skin, the true gypsy color,
            which is at the base of the more or less dark brown of other eastern
            peoples, is just as characteristic and <a data-ip-footnote-id="[4]"
            >maintains itself as
            constantly</a> as the black color of the Negroes; and it seems, along
            with the rest of the formation and the different temperament, to be
            as much the effect of a dry heat as the other of a moist one.
            According to Ives, the common <a data-ip-footnote-id="[5]"
            >diseases of the Indians are congested
            gall-bladders and swollen livers; but their innate color is inclined
            to yellow anyway and seems to indicate a continuous excretion of the
            gall that has entered the blood</a> and that in saponified form
            dissolves perhaps the thickened juices and dissipates them and
            thereby cools blood at least in the external parts.</p> <p>So now we have
            surmises which at least are substantial enough to be counterpoise
            for those other surmises which find the differences in the human
            genus so impossible to reconcile that they prefer to assume discrete
            local creations. To say with Voltaire, God who created the reindeer
            in Lapland to devour the moss of the cold regions, created also the
            Laplander to eat the reindeer, is no poor flash for a poet; but is a
            bad expedient for the philosopher who may not depart from the chain
            of natural causes except where the direction it is immediately bound
            to take is obvious to him.</p> <p>We have counted four human races under
            which all the manifold variations of this genus are supposed to the
            conceived. But all deviations need nevertheless a stem genus; and
            either we must declare it now extinct, or else we must seek among
            those extant the one which we can best compare to the stem-genus. To
            be sure we cannot hope any more to come upon the unaltered original
            human form anywhere in the world. . . .</p> <p><i>“On National
            Characteristics”</i></p> <p>If we cast a fleeting glance over the other parts
            of the world, we find the Arab the noblest man in the Orient, yet of
            a feeling that degenerates very much into the adventurous. He is
            hospitable, generous, and truthful; yet his narrative and history
            and on the whole his feeling are always interwoven with some
            wonderful thing. His inflamed imagination presents things to him in
            unnatural and distorted images, and even the propagation of his
            religion was a great adventure. If the Arabs are, so to speak, the
            Spaniards of the Orient, similarly the Persians are the French of
            Asia. They are good poets, courteous and o fairly fine taste. They
            are not such strict followers of Islam, and they permit to their
            pleasure-prone disposition a tolerably mild interpretation of the
            Koran. The Japanese could in a way be regarded as the <a data-ip-footnote-id="[6]"
            >Englishmen</a> of
            this part of the world, but hardly in any other quality than their
            resoluteness – which degenerates into the utmost stubbornness –
            their valor, and disdain of death. For the rest, they display few
            signs of a finer feeling. The Indians have a dominating taste of the
            grotesque, of the sort that falls into the adventurous. Their
            religion consists of grotesqueries. Idols of monstrous form, the
            priceless tooth of the mighty monkey Hanuman, the unnatural
            atonements of the fakirs (heathen mendicant friars) and so forth are
            in this taste. The despotic sacrifice of wives in the very same
            funeral pyre that consumes the corpse of the husband is a hideous
            excess. What trifling grotesqueries do the verbose and studied
            compliments of the Chinese contain! Even their paintings are
            grotesque and portray strange and unnatural figures such as are
            encountered nowhere in the world. They also have venerable
            grotesqueries because they are of very ancient custom, and no nation
            in the world has more of these than this one.</p> <p>The Negroes of Africa
            have by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling. Mr Hume
            challenges anyone to cite a single example in which a Negro has
            shown talents, and asserts that among the hundreds of thousands of
            blacks who are transported elsewhere from their countries, although
            many of them have even been set free, still not a single one was
            ever found <a data-ip-footnote-id="[7]"
            >who presented anything great in art or science</a> or any
            other praiseworthy quality, even though among the whites some
            continually rise aloft from the lowest rabble, and through superior
            gifts earn respect in the world. So fundamental is the difference
            between these two races of man, and it appears to be as great in
            regard to the mental capacities as in color. The religion of
            fetishes so widespread among them is perhaps a sort of idolatry that
            sinks as deeply into the trifling as appears to be possible to human
            nature. A bird feather, a cow’s horn, a conch shell, or any other
            common object, as soon as it becomes consecrated by a few words, is
            an object of veneration and of invocation in swearing oaths. The
            blacks are very vain but in the Negro’s way, and so talkative that
            they must be driven apart from each other with thrashings.</p> <p>Among all
            savages there is no nation that displays to sublime a mental
            character as those of North America. They have a strong feeling for
            honor, and as in quest of it they seek wild adventures hundreds of
            miles abroad, they are still extremely careful to avert the least
            injury to it when their equally harsh enemy, upon capturing them,
            seeks by cruel pain to extort cowardly groans from them. The
            Canadian savage, moreover, is truthful and honest. The friendship he
            establishes is just as adventurous and enthusiastic as anything of
            that kind reported from the most ancient and fabled times. He is
            extremely proud, feels the whole worth of freedom, and even in his
            education suffers no encounter that would let him feel a low
            subservience. Lycurgus probably gave statues to just such savages;
            and if a lawgiver arose among the Six Nations, one would see a
            Spartan republic rise in the New World; for the undertaking of the
            Argonauts is little different from the war parties of these Indians,
            and Jason excels <a data-ip-footnote-id="Attakakullakulla (Attakullakulla), Cherokee leader."
            >Attakakullakulla</a> in nothing but the honor of a
            Greek name. All these savages have little feeling for the beautiful
            in moral understanding, and the generous forgiveness of an injury,
            which is at once noble and beautiful, is completely unknown as a
            virtue among the savages, but rather is disdained as a miserable
            cowardice. For is the greatest merit of the savage and revenge his
            sweetest bliss. The remaining natives of this part of the world show
            few traces of a mental character disposed to the finer feelings, and
            an extraordinary apathy constitutes the mark of this type of race.</p>
            <p>If we examine the relation of the sexes in these parts of the world,
            we find that the European alone has found the secret of decorating
            with so many flowers the sensual charm of a mighty inclination and
            of interlacing it with so much morality that he has not only
            extremely elevated its agreeableness but has also made it very
            decorous. The inhabitant of the Orient is of a very false taste in
            this respect. Since he has no concept of the morally beautiful which
            can be united with this impulse, he loses even the worth of the
            sensuous enjoyment, and his harem is a constant source of unrest. He
            thrives on all sorts of amorous grotestqueries, among which the
            imaginary jewel is only the foremost, which he seeks to safeguard
            above all else, whose whole worth consists only in smashing it, and
            of which one in our part of the world generally entertains much
            malicious doubt—and yet to whose preservation he makes use of very
            unjust and often loathsome means. Hence there a woman is always in a
            prison, whether she may be a maid, or have a barbaric,
            good-for-nothing and always suspicious husband. In the lands of the
            black, what better can one expect than what is found prevailing,
            namely the feminine sex in the deepest slavery? A despairing man is
            always a strict master over anyone weaker, just as with us that man
            is always a tyrant in the kitchen who outside his own house hardly
            dares to look anyone in the face. Of course, Father Labat reports
            that a Negro carpenter, whom he reproached for haughty treatment
            toward his wives, answered: “You white are indeed fools, for first
            you make great concessions to your wives, and afterward you complain
            when they drive you mad.” And it might be that there were something
            in this which perhaps deserved to be considered; but in short, this
            fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that he was
            stupid. Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is
            held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada. In this they
            surpass perhaps even our civilized part of the world. It is not as
            if they paid the women humble respects; those would be mere
            compliments. No, they actually exercise authority. They assemble and
            deliberate upon the most important regulations of the nation, even
            upon the question of war or peace. They thereupon send their
            deputies to the men’s council and generally it is their voice that
            determines the decision. But they purchase this privilege dearly
            enough. They are burdened with all the domestic concerns, and
            furthermore share all the hardships of the men.</p> <p><i>Physical Geography</i></p>
            <p>On Countries that are Known and Unknown to Europeans</p> <p><i>Africa</i></p> <p>Another
            object which interests the archeologists would be a more precise
            knowledge of Egypt. Besides, Africa deserves the most careful
            investigation, and it seems to have been better known by the
            ancients in its interior than by us, because they traveled more by
            land. Even many of the coastlines of this continent are still
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Map of Africa - 18th Century">unknown today</a> to the Europeans and the center of the continent
            completely eludes our gaze. It is only Egypt that we know somewhat
            more exactly, but even here what we know is extremely little.</p> <p>We
            have reason to assume the existence of a significant lake in Africa
            into which the eastern, and not as otherwise believed the western,
            branch of the Niger river flows. Incidentally, we also come across
            the largest and most beautiful animals on this continent as well as
            the best plants. According to some accounts, timid Portuguese
            believed the most beautiful interior parts of Africa to be peopled
            with [African] cannibals who even fattened up humans up for
            slaughter. However, we should not attach credibility to such fables
            so easily because experience has taught us that these people only
            slaughter their prisoners of war whom they capture while still
            alive, and then with great ceremony… Whenever [Europeans] did not
            know much about the country, someone would say that it was inhabited
            by cannibals, despite the fact that there are very few of these
            kinds of people or even more correctly, none at all.</p> <p>The number of
            names of countries and towns on the map of Africa is quite
            considerable; but one would be much mistaken if one were to believe
            that wherever there is a name there are inhabitants… The reason that
            the interior of Africa is so unknown to us, as if they were
            countries of the moon, lies far more with us Europeans than with the
            Africans, in that we have made ourselves suspects through slave
            trade. The coast of Africa is, in fact, visited by Europeans; but
            these journeys are very violent because Europeans carry away each
            year between 60,000 and 80,000 Negroes to America. Thus it has come
            to pass that even up until modern times hardly 30 miles from the
            coast into the interior of this continent is known to Europeans…</p>
            <p>Geographical distribution of humans</p> <p>If we begin with the inhabitants
            of the icy zones, we find that their color approaches that of the
            inhabitants of the hot zones. The Samoyeds, the Danish and Swedish
            Lapplanders, the Greenlanders, and those who live in the icy zone of
            America have a brown facial color and black hair. Here great cold
            appears to have the same effect as great heat. Like the people in
            the hot pans of the world they also have a very sparse beard. Their
            build is like that of a tree-trunk. It is small, their legs are
            short, they have a broad and flat face and a large mouth.</p> <p>Those who
            live closest to them in the temperate zones (except the Kalmucks and
            the peoples related to their tribe) have a blond or brownish hair
            and skin color and are greater in stature. The tallest and most
            beautiful people on dry land are on the parallel and the degrees
            which run through Germany… In the northern parts of Mongolia,
            Kashmir, Georgia, Mingrelien, and Ciracassien as far as the
            British-American colonies, one finds people of blond color, well
            formed, with blue eyes. The further south one goes, there increases
            the brunette color, the thinness, and the small stature which
            degenerates into the Indian-yellow or Moorish figure.</p> <p>One can say
            that the only <a data-ip-footnote-id="[8]"
            >true</a> Negroes are in Africa and New Guinea. Not just
            the evenly smoked-black color but also the black woolly hair, the
            broad face, the flat nose, and the thick lips constitute the
            characteristics of these people, in addition to clumsy large bones.
            In Asia these blacks have neither the deep black color nor the
            woolly hair, unless they are descended from people who have been
            brought over from Africa. There is no native black person in
            America, where the facial color is copper and the hair is straight.
            However there are large groups of descendants of the African slaves.</p>
            <p>In Africa one calls Moors those brown people who are descendants of
            the Mauren. The actual black people are the Negroes. The
            above-mentioned Moors stretch along the coast of Barbary to Senegal.
            In comparison, from there to Gambia are the blackest Moors, but also
            the most beautiful in the world, above all the Wolofs. The Fuli are
            black-brown. On the Gold Coast they are not so black and have very
            thick lips. Those from Congo and Angola to Cape Negro are a little
            less so. The Hottentots are only black-brown but they have an
            otherwise quite Moorish appearance. On the other side (of the Cape),
            namely the eastern side, the Caffers like the Abyssinians, are not
            true Negroes.</p> <p><i>A few curiosities about the blacks</i></p> 
          </b>
          <p>1. The Negroes are
            born <a data-ip-footnote-id="[9]"
            >white</a> apart from their genitals and a ring around the navel,
            which are black. During the first months of life the black color
            spreads out from these parts over the whole body.</p> <p>2. When a Negro
            burns himself the spot turns white. Long illnesses also turn the
            Negroes quite white; but a body that has become white through
            illness turns blacker in death than it ever was before.</p> <p>3. The
            Europeans who live in this hot belt of the world do not become
            Negroes after many generations but rather <a data-ip-footnote-id="[10]"
            >retain</a> their European
            figure and color. The Portuguese on Cape Verde, who should become
            Negroes in 200 years are Mulattos.</p> <p>4. The Negroes, if they do not
            mix with white people, <a data-ip-footnote-id="[11]"
            >remain over many generations Negroes</a>, even in
            Virginia.</p> <p>5. White and black mixed produces <a data-ip-footnote-id="Video for reference: Racial caste system. Details from 5:12"
              ><i>Mulattos</i></a>. The children
            that the latter have with whites are called in <a data-ip-footnote-id="The Spanish colonial racial hierarchy">Spanish America</a>
            <i>Terzerons</i>; their children out of a marriage with a white person a
            <i>Quarteron</i>, their children with whites <i>Quinteron</i>, and their children
            with whites are then once again called white. However, when a
            Terzeron marries a Mulatto woman, the children are generated
            backwards along this color-chain.</p> <p>6. The inhabitants of the
            <i>Cordilleren</i> resemble the Europeans; in Ethiopia, they look brown.</p> <p>7.
            Occasionally there are white Moors or Albinos who come from black
            parents. They are Moorish in figure, have curly, snow-white, woolly
            hair, are pale and can only see in moonlight.</p> <p>8 The Moors, like all
            inhabitants of the hot zones have a thick skin; when one disciplines
            them, one cannot hit with sticks but rather whip with split canes,
            so that the blood finds a way out and does not suppurate under the
            skin.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b><i>Opinions on the origin of blackness</i></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people imagine that Ham is the father of the Moors and that God
            made him black as a punishment which now all his descendants have
            inherited. However, one can provide no proof as to why the color
            black should be the mark of a curse in a more fitting fashion than
            the color white.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many physicians believe that the color black comes from the
            epidermis and the black substance of which it is stained. Still
            others trace it to the reticular membrane. Because the color of
            humans goes through all the shades of yellow, brown and dark brown
            until it becomes black in the hot parts of the earth, it is clear
            that the reason for it is the hot climate. However, it is certain
            that a great number of generations has been needed for it to become
            part of the species and hereditary.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that the drying up [by the hot sun] of the vessels that
            carry the blood and serum under the skin brings about the lack of a
            beard and the short curly hair. Likewise, because the sunlight that
            falls through the surface skin into the dried up vessels eats up the
            reticular membrane, there arises the appearance of a black color.
          </p>
          <p>
            How such a coincidental thing as color could, however, become part
            of a species cannot be explained so easily. But one sees from other
            examples that this is the situation in other parts of nature. The
            reason why some hens become quite white in color can be explained by
            the difference in food, air and the way in which they are raised;
            and if one chooses only the white chicks from the many chicks that
            come from one set of parents and puts them together, one finally
            achieves a white race -a result which does not easily turn out
            differently. Is this not the way that English and Arabian or Spanish
            horses raised on dry land generate themselves, so that they finally
            create foals of a quite different build? All dogs that are brought
            from Europe to Africa become dumb and bald and produce only similar
            offspring thereafter. Similar changes occur with sheep, cows and
            other species of animal. The fact that Moors occasionally have a
            white child happens for the same reason that, now and again, there
            appears a white raven, a white crow or blackbird.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that it is the heat of the area- rather than a particular
            set of parents- that causes blackness can be seen by the fact that
            in the same country [Africa] those that live in the flat parts are
            far blacker than those who live in the high altitudes. That is why
            the blacker people live in Senegal than in Congo, and blacker people
            live in Angola than in Upper Ethiopia or in Abyssinia.

            All oriental nations that lie towards the East on the meridian of
            Bengal have something of the Kalmucks or Tartars about them. They
            are made in the following way: a face that is wide on top and narrow
            and flat below, amost no protruding nose, very small eyes, very
            thick eyebrows, black hair, thin and sparse tufts of hear instead of
            a beard and short legs with fat calves. Shaped in this manner are
            the eastern Tartars, the Chinese, the Arak, the Siamese, the
            Japanese, etc., although they all make themselves more beautiful on
            occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whithout taking notice notice of the superstitioous opinions about
            the origins of certain forms [Bildungen] one can make only the
            following remark with certainty: namely, that in this area of
            Melkapur on the Coromandel coast, there are many people with very
            fat legs. A few sensible travelers trace the fat legs to the
            constitution of the water, in the same way as goiters in the Tyrol
            and Salzburg are similarly supposed to stem from the water, which
            contains sinter. The giants of Patagonia are, at least as a people
            of giants, fictitious. The same fictitious origin could be ascribed
            to the people with raw and huge lips that are supposed to live in
            Senegal, who hold a cloth in front of the mouth and communicate
            without speech. The people Plinius spoke of, the one-eyed, bumpy,
            one-footed people without a mouth, dwarves and the like, also belong
            to this category.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inhabitants of the coast of New Holland have half-closed eyes
            and cannot see into the distance without tilting their heads right
            back. They accustom themselves to this because of the many
            mosquitoes that are always flying into their eyes. Some peoples,
            like the Moors of Sierra Leone and the Mongols who are within the
            area of China, spread an evil smell. Among the Hottentots, as Kolbe
            reports, many women develop a piece of leather on their pubic bone
            which partially covers their reproductive organs, and which they are
            supposed to cut off from time to time. Ludolph reports the same of
            many Egyptian (Ethiopian) women. (See Le Vaillant's Travels.) The
            people on Formosa, in the interior of Borneo etc., who possess the
            beginnings of an ape's tail ... seem to be not completely
            fictitious.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the hot countries the human being matures in all aspects earlier,
            but does not, however, reach the perfection of those in the
            temperate zones. Humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race
            of the whites. The yellow Indians do have a meagre talent. The
            Negroes are far below them and at the lowest point are a part of the
            American peoples.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moors and the other peoples between the tropics of Cancer and
            Capricorn can run quite astonishingly. They as well as other savages
            have more strength than the other civilized peoples, which stems
            from the free movement allowed them in their childhood. The
            Hottentots can perceive a ship with the naked eye at the same
            distance as a European can with a telescope. The women in the
            hottest parts of the world already produce children at the age of 9
            or 10 and finish before they are 25 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don Ulloa remarks that in Cartagena in America and in the
            surrounding areas people become clever very early but they do not
            continue to grow in intelligence at the same rate. All inhabitants
            of the hottest zones are exceptionally lethargic. With so this
            laziness is somewhat mitigated by rule and force.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an Indian sees a European going somewhere, he thinks that he
            has something to accomplish. When he comes back, he thinks that he
            has already taken care of his business, but if he sees him going out
            a third time he thinks that he has lost his mind, as the European is
            going for a walk for pleasure, which no Indian does; he is only
            capable of imagining it. Indians are also indecisive, and both
            traits belong to the nations that live very far north. The weakening
            of their limbs is supposedly caused by brandy, tobacco, opium and
            other strong things. From their timidity comes superstition,
            particularly in regard to magic, and the same with jealousy. Their
            timidity makes them into slavish underlings when they have kings and
            evokes an idolatrous reverence in them, just as their laziness moves
            them rather to run around in the forest and suffer need than to be
            held to their labors by the orders of their masters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Montesquieu is correct in his judgment that the weak-heartedness
            that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the Negro also makes
            him fear many things other than death that the European can
            withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns himself if he is to be
            forced into slavery. The Indian women burn themselves. The Carib
            commits suicide at the slightest provocation. The Peruvian trembles
            in the face of an enemy, and when he is led to death, he is
            ambivalent, as though it means nothing. His awakened imagination,
            however, also makes him dare to do something but the heat of the
            moment is soon past and timidity resumes its old place again…

          <p>
            The inhabitant of the temperate parts of the world, above all the
            central part, has a more beautiful body, works harder, is more
            jocular, more controlled in his passions, more intelligent than any
            other race of people in the world. That is why at all points in time
            these peoples have educated the others and controlled them with
            weapons.
