          <br>
          [However, the most intelligible case of all, namely the derivation of the Americans, as the not completely adapted race of people which has long inhabited the northernmost region of the world, will be well confirmed by the suppressed growth of hair on all parts of the body except the head, by the reddish, rusty color characteristic of the colder tern tones and the darker copper color of the hotter ones of this continent. For the red-brown appears to be suited (an effect of the atmospheric acids) as well to the cold climate as olive-brown (as an effect of the alkaline-bilious condition of the juices) to the hot; to say nothing of the temperament of the Americans; which temperament betrays a half-extinguished body-force, which can most naturally be looked upon as the effect of a cold world-region.<br><br>On the other hand, the extreme damp heat of the warm climate must show, upon a people that has aged in it sufficiently to have become fully adapted to its soil, effects that are quite the opposite of the former. It is precisely the opposite appearance from the Kalmuck formation that is engendered. The growth of the spongy parts of the body must increase in a hot, moist climate; hence a thick snub-nose and tumid lips. The skin must be oily, not only to moderate the influence of evaporation but also to prevent the injurious absorption of the noxious vapors of the air the superabundance of the iron particles, which are present in all human blood, and which are precipitated in the reticular substance through evaporation of the acids of phosphorus (which make all Negroes stink) cause the blackness that shines through the superficial skin; and the high iron content of the blood seems also necessary in order to forestall a slackening of all parts. The oil of the skin which weakens the nutrient mucus that is requisite for hair growth has permitted hardly even the production of a woolly covering for the head.]Besides all this, damp heat promotes strong growth in animals in general; in short, the Negro is produced, well suited to his climate; that is, strong, fleshy, supple, but in the midst of the bountiful provision of his motherland lazy, soft and dawdling.<br><br>
          The native of Hindustan may be looked upon as having sprung from one of the oldest human races. His country, braced to the north against a high mountain range and from north to south to the tip of the peninsula traversed by a long mountain chain (to which I count also Tibet in the north which perhaps was the common place of refuge for mankind and his stock of vegetation after the last great revolution of our earth), has in an equable atmosphere the most perfect drainage-divide, such as is possessed by no other part of the Asiatic mainland situated in an equable climate. It therefore has been dry and habitable even in the most ancient times, since both the eastern peninsula of India and China must have been still uninhabited in those times of floods (for in them the rivers, instead of being divided, run parallel). Here then it was possible for a firm human race to take its foundation over a long period of time. The olive-yellow of the Indian skin, the true gypsy color, which is at the base of the more or less dark brown of other eastern peoples, is just as characteristic and maintains itself as constantly as the black color of the Negroes; and it seems, along with the rest of the formation and the different temperament, to be as much the effect of a dry heat as the other of a moist one. According to Ives, the common diseases of the Indians are congested gall-bladders and swollen livers; but their innate color is inclined to yellow anyway and seems to indicate a continuous excretion of the gall that has entered the blood and that in saponified form dissolves perhaps the thickened juices and dissipates them and thereby cools blood at least in the external parts.<br><br>
          So now we have surmises which at least are substantial enough to be counterpoise for those other surmises which find the differences in the human genus so impossible to reconcile that they prefer to assume discrete local creations. To say with Voltaire, God who created the reindeer in Lapland to devour the moss of the cold regions, created also the Laplander to eat the reindeer, is [no poor flash for a poet; but is] a bad expedient for the philosopher who may not depart from the chain of natural causes [except where the direction it is immediately bound to take is obvious to him.] <br><br>
          We have counted four human races under which all the manifold variations of this genus are supposed to the conceived. But all deviations need nevertheless a stem genus; and either we must declare it now extinct, or else we must seek among those extant the one which we can best compare to the stem-genus. To be sure we cannot hope any more to come upon the unaltered original human form anywhere in the world. . . . <br>

          “On National Characteristics,” from <a data-ip-footnote-id="3"><i>Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime</i></a> (1764)<br>
          <br>
          If we cast a fleeting glance over the other parts of the world, we find the Arab the noblest man in the Orient, yet of a feeling that degenerates very much into the adventurous. He is hospitable, generous, and truthful; yet his narrative and history and on the whole his feeling are always interwoven with some wonderful thing. His inflamed imagination presents things to him in unnatural and distorted images, and even the propagation of his religion was a great adventure. If the Arabs are, so to speak, the Spaniards of the Orient, similarly the Persians are the French of Asia. They are good poets, courteous and o fairly fine taste. They are not such strict followers of Islam, and they permit to their pleasure-prone disposition a tolerably mild interpretation of the Koran. The Japanese could in a way be regarded as the Englishmen of this part of the world, but hardly in any other quality than their resoluteness – which degenerates into the utmost stubbornness – their valor, and disdain of death. For the rest, they display few signs of a finer feeling. The Indians have a dominating taste of the grotesque, of the sort that falls into the adventurous. Their religion consists of grotesqueries. Idols of monstrous form, the priceless tooth of the mighty monkey Hanuman, the unnatural atonements of the fakirs (heathen mendicant friars) and so forth are in this taste. The despotic sacrifice of wives in the very same funeral pyre that consumes the corpse of the husband is a hideous excess. What trifling grotesqueries do the verbose and studied compliments of the Chinese contain! Even their paintings are grotesque and portray strange and unnatural figures such as are encountered nowhere in the world. They also have venerable grotesqueries because they are of very ancient custom, and no nation in the world has more of these than this one. <br><br>
          The Negroes of Africa have by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling. Mr Hume challenges anyone to cite a single example in which a Negro has shown talents, and asserts that among the hundreds of thousands of blacks who are transported elsewhere from their countries, although many of them have even been set free, still not a single one was ever found who presented anything great in art or science or any other praiseworthy quality, even though among the whites some continually rise aloft from the lowest rabble, and through superior gifts earn respect in the world. So fundamental is the difference between these two races of man, and it appears to be as great in regard to the mental capacities as in color. The religion of fetishes so widespread among them is perhaps a sort of idolatry that sinks as deeply into the trifling as appears to be possible to human nature. A bird feather, a cow’s horn, a conch shell, or any other common object, as soon as it becomes consecrated by a few words, is an object of veneration and of invocation in swearing oaths. The blacks are very vain but in the Negro’s way, and so talkative that they must be driven apart from each other with thrashings. <br><br>
          Among all savages there is no nation that displays to sublime a mental character as those of North America. They have a strong feeling for honor, and as in quest of it they seek wild adventures hundreds of miles abroad, they are still extremeley careful to avert the least injury to it when their equally harsh enemy, upon capturing them, seeks by cruel pain to extort cowardly groans from them. The Canadian savage, moreover, is truthful and honest. The friendship he establishes is just as adventurous and enthusiastic as anything of that kind reported from the most ancient and fabled times. He is extremely proud, feels the whole worth of freedom, and even in his education suffers no encounter that would let him feel a low subservience. Lycurgus probably gave statues to just such savages; and if a lawgiver arose among the Six Nations, one would see a Spartan republic rise in the New World; for the undertaking of the Argonauts is little different from the war parties of these Indians, and Jason excels Attakakullakulla in nothing but the honor of a Greek name. All these savages have little feeling for the beautiful in moral understanding, and the generous forgiveness of an injury, which is at once noble and beautiful, is completely unknown as a virtue among the savages, but rather is disdained as a miserable cowardice. Vlor is the greatest merit of the savage and revenge his sweetest bliss. The remaining natives of this part of the world show few traces of a mental character disposed to the finer feelings, and an extraordinary apathy constitutes the mark of this type of race. <br><br>
          If we examine the relation of the sexes in these parts of the world, we find that the European alone has found the secret of decorating with so many flowers the sensual charm of a mighty inclination and of interlacing it with so much morality that he has not only extremely elevated its agreeableness but has also made it very decorous. The inhabitant of the Orient is of a very false taste in this respect. Since he has no concept of the morally beautiful which can be united with this impulse, he loses even the worth of the sensuous enjoyment, and his harem is a constant source of unrest. He thrives on all sorts of amorous grotestqueries, among which the imaginary jewel is only the foremost, which he seeks to safeguard above all else, whose whole worth consists only in smashing it, and of which one in our part of the world generally entertains much malicious doubt—and yet to whose preservation he makes use of very unjust and often loathsome means. Hence there a woman is always in a prison, whether she may be a maid, or have a barbaric, good-for-nothing and always suspicious husband. In the lands of the black, what better can one expect than what is found prevailing, namely the feminine sex in the deepest slavery? A despairing man is always a strict master over anyone weaker, just as with us that man is always a tyrant in the kitchen who outside his own house hardly dares to look anyone in the face. Of course, Father Labat reports that a Negro caprenter, whom he reproached for haughty treatment toward his wives, answered: “You white are indeed fools, for first you make great concessions to your wives, and afterward you complain when they drive you mad.” And it might be that there were something in this which perhaps deserved to be considred; but in short, this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that he was stupid. Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada. In this they surpass perhaps even our civilized part of the world. It is not as if they paid the women humble respects; those would be mere compliments. No, they actually exercise authority. They assemble and deliberate upon the most important regulations of the nation, even upon the question of war or peace. They thereupon send their deputies to the men’s council and generally it is their voice that determines the decision. But they purchase this privilege dearly enough. They are burdened with all the domestic concerns, and furthermore share all the hardships of the men.<br>

          Another object which interests the archeologists would be a more precise
          knowledge of Egypt. Besides, Africa deserves the most careful investigation,
          and it seems to have been better known by the ancients in its interior than by
          us, because they traveled more by land. Even many of the coastlines of
          this continent are still unknown today to the Europeans and the center of the
          continent completely eludes our gaze. It is only Egypt that we know
          somewhat more exactly, but even here what we know is extremely little.<br>
          <br>
          We have reason to assume the existence of a significant lake in Africa
          into which the eastern, and not as otherwise believed the western, branch of
          the Niger river flows. Incidentally, we also come across the largest and
          most beautiful animals on this continent as well as the best plants.
          According to some accounts, timid Portuguese believed the most
          beautiful interior parts of Africa to be peopled with [African] cannibals
          who even fattened up humans up for slaughter. However, we should not
          attach credibility to such fables so easily because experience has taught us
          that these people only slaughter their prisoners of war whom they capture
          while still alive, and then with great ceremony… Whenever [Europeans] did
          not know much about the country, someone would say that it was inhabited
          by cannibals, despite the fact that there are very few of these kinds of people
          or even more correctly, none at all.<br>
          <br>
          The number of names of countries and towns on the map of Africa is quite
          considerable; but one would be much mistaken if one were to believe that
          wherever there is a name there are inhabitants… The reason that the interior
          of Africa is so unknown to us, as if they were countries of the moon, lies far
          more with us Europeans than with the Africans, in that we have
          made ourselves suspects through slave trade. The coast of Africa is, in fact,
          visited by Europeans; but these journeys are very violent because Europeans
          carry away each year between 60,000 and 80,000 Negroes to America. Thus
          it has come to pass that even up until modern times hardly 30 miles from the
          coast into the interior of this continent is known to Europeans…<br>
          <br>
          Geographical distribution of humans<br>
          <br>
          If we begin with the inhabitants of the icy zones, we find that their color
          approaches that of the inhabitants of the hot zones. The Samoyeds, the
          Danish and Swedish Lapplanders, the Greenlanders, and those who live in
          the icy zone of America have a brown facial color and black hair. Here great
          cold appears to have the same effect as great heat. Like the people in the
          hot pans of the world they also have a very sparse beard. Their build is like
          that of a tree-trunk. It is small, their legs are short, they have a broad and flat
          face and a large mouth.<br>
          <br>
          Those who live closest to them in the temperate zones (except the Kalmucks
          and the peoples related to their tribe) have a blond or brownish hair and skin
          color and are greater in stature. The tallest and most beautiful people on dry
          land are on the parallel and the degrees which run through Germany… In the
          northern parts of Mongolia, Kashmir, Georgia, Mingrelien, and
          Ciracassien as far as the British-American colonies, one finds people of
          blond color, well formed, with blue eyes. The further south one goes, there
          increases the brunette color, the thinness, and the small stature which
          degenerates into the Indian-yellow or Moorish figure.<br>
          <br>
          One can say that the only true Negroes are in Africa and New Guinea. Not
          just the evenly smoked-black color but also the black woolly hair, the broad
          face, the flat nose, and the thick lips constitute the characteristics of these
          people, in addition to clumsy large bones. In Asia these blacks have neither
          the deep black color nor the woolly hair, unless they are descended
          from people who have been brought over from Africa. There is no native
          black person in America, where the facial color is copper and the hair is
          straight. However there are large groups of descendants of the African
          slaves.<br>
          <br>
          In Africa one calls Moors those brown people who are descendants of the
          <i>Mauren</i>. The actual black people are the Negroes. The above-mentioned
          Moors stretch along the coast of Barbary to Senegal. In comparison, from
          there to Gambia are the blackest Moors, but also the most beautiful in the
          world, above all the Wolofs. The Fuli are black-brown. On the Gold Coast
          they are not so black and have very thick lips. Those from Congo and Angola
          to Cape Negro are a little less so. The Hottentots are only black-brown but
          they have an otherwise quite Moorish appearance. On the other side (of the
          Cape), namely the eastern side, the Caffers like the Abyssinians, are not true
          Negroes.<br>
          <br>
          <i>A few curiosities about the blacks</i><br>
          <br>
          1. The Negroes are born white apart from their genitals and a ring around the
          navel, which are black. During the first months of life the black color spreads
          out from these parts over the whole body.<br>
          <br>
          2. When a Negro burns himself the spot turns white. Long illnesses also turn
          the Negroes quite white; but a body that has become white through illness
          turns blacker in death than it ever was before.<br>
          <br>
          3. The Europeans who live in this hot belt of the world do not become
          Negroes after many generations but rather retain their European figure and
          color. The Portuguese on Cape Verde, who should become Negroes in 200
          years are Mulattos.<br>
          <br>
          4. The Negroes, if they do not mix with white people, remain over many
          generations Negroes, even in Virginia.<br>
          <br>
          5. White and black mixed produces <i>Mulattos</i>. The children that the latter
          have with whites are called in Spanish America Terzerons; their children
          out of a marriage with a white person a Quarteron, their children with
          whites Quinteron, and their children with whites are then once again called
          white. However, when a Terzeron marries a Mulatto woman, the children are
          generated backwards along this color-chain.<br>
          <br>
          6. The inhabitants of the <i>Cordilleren</i> resemble the Europeans; in Ethiopia,
          they look brown.<br>
          <br>
          7. Occasionally there are white Moors or Albinos who come from black
          parents. They are Moorish in figure, have curly, snow-white, woolly hair, are
          pale and can only see in moonlight.<br>
          <br>
          8. The Moors, like all inhabitants of the hot zones have a thick skin; when
          one disciplines them, one cannot hit with sticks but rather whip with split
          canes, so that the blood finds a way out and does not suppurate under the
          skin.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Opinions on the origin of blackness</i><br>
          <br>
          Some people imagine that Ham is the father of the Moors and that God
          made him black as a punishment which now all his descendants have
          inherited. However, one can provide no proof as to why the color black
          should be the mark of a curse in a more fitting fashion than the color
          white.<br>
          <br>
          Many physicians believe that the color black comes from the epidermis
          and the black substance of which it is stained. Still others trace it to the
          reticular membrane. Because the color of humans goes through all the
          shades of yellow, brown and dark brown until it becomes black in the
          hot parts of the earth, it is clear that the reason for it is the hot climate.
          However, it is certain that a great number of generations has been needed
          for it to become part of the species and hereditary.<br>
          <br>
          It appears that the drying up [by the hot sun] of the vessels that carry the
          blood and serum under the skin brings about the lack of a beard and the
          short curly hair. Likewise, because the sunlight that falls through the
          surface skin into the dried up vessels eats up the reticular membrane, there
          arises the appearance of a black color.<br>
          <br>
          How such a coincidental thing as color could, however, become part of a
          species cannot be explained so easily. But one sees from other examples that
          this is the situation in other parts of nature. The reason why some hens
          become quite white in color can be explained by the difference in food, air
          and the way in which they are raised; and if one chooses only the white
          chicks from the many chicks that come from one set of parents and puts them
          together, one finally achieves a white race -a result which does not easily turn
          out differently. Is this not the way that English and Arabian or Spanish horses
          raised on dry land generate themselves, so that they finally create foals of a
          quite different build? All dogs that are brought from Europe to
          Africa become dumb and bald and produce only similar offspring
          thereafter. Similar changes occur with sheep, cows and other species of
          animal. The fact that Moors occasionally have a white child happens for the
          same reason that, now and again, there appears a white raven, a white crow
          or blackbird.<br>
          <br>
          The fact that it is the heat of the area- rather than a particular set of parentsthat
          causes blackness can be seen by the fact that in the same country
          [Africa] those that live in the flat parts are far blacker than those who live in
          the high altitudes. That is why the blacker people live in Senegal than in
          Congo, and blacker people live in Angola than in Upper Ethiopia or in
          Abyssinia.<br>
          <br>
          Innate characteristics of the human being considered throughout the whole
          world<br>
          <br>
          All oriental nations that lie towards the East on the meridian of Bengal
          have something of the Kalmucks or Tartars about them. They are made in
          the following way: a face that is wide on top and narrow and flat below,
          amost no protruding nose, very small eyes, very thick eyebrows, black
          hair, thin and sparse tufts of hear instead of a beard and short legs with fat
          calves. Shaped in this manner are the eastern Tartars, the Chinese, the
          Arak, the Siamese, the Japanese, etc., although they all make themselves
          more beautiful on occasion.<br>
          <br>
          Whithout taking notice notice of the superstitioous opinions about the
          origins of certain forms [<i>Bildungen</i>] one can make only the following
          remark with certainty: namely, that in this area of Melkapur on the
          Coromandel coast, there are many people with very fat legs. A few sensible
          travelers trace the fat legs to the constitution of the water, in the same way
          as goiters in the Tyrol and Salzburg are similarly supposed to stem from the
          water, which contains sinter. The giants of Patagonia are, at least as a people
          of giants, fictitious. The same fictitious origin could be ascribed to the
          people with raw and huge lips that are supposed to live in Senegal, who hold
          a cloth in front of the mouth and communicate without speech. The people
          Plinius spoke of, the one-eyed, bumpy, one-footed people without a mouth,
          dwarves and the like, also belong to this category.<br>
          <br>
          The inhabitants of the coast of New Holland have half-closed eyes and
          cannot see into the distance without tilting their heads right back. They
          accustom themselves to this because of the many mosquitoes that are always
          flying into their eyes. Some peoples, like the Moors of Sierra Leone and the
          Mongols who are within the area of China, spread an evil smell. Among the
          Hottentots, as Kolbe reports, many women develop a piece of leather on their
          pubic bone which partially covers their reproductive organs, and which they
          are supposed to cut off from time to time. Ludolph reports the same of
          many Egyptian (Ethiopian) women. (See Le Vaillant's Travels.) The people
          on Formosa, in the interior of Borneo etc., who possess the beginnings of an
          ape's tail ... seem to be not completely fictitious.<br>
          <br>
          In the hot countries the human being matures in all aspects earlier, but does
          not, however, reach the perfection of those in the temperate zones. Humanity
          is at its greatest perfection in the race of the whites. The yellow Indians do
          have a meagre talent. The Negroes are far below them and at the lowest point
          are a part of the American peoples.<br>
          <br>
          The Moors and the other peoples between the tropics of Cancer and
          Capricorn can run quite astonishingly. They as well as other savages have
          more strength than the other civilized peoples, which stems from the free
          movement allowed them in their childhood. The Hottentots can perceive a
          ship with the naked eye at the same distance as a European can with a
          telescope. The women in the hottest parts of the world already produce
          children at the age of 9 or 10 and finish before they are 25 years old.
          Don Ulloa remarks that in Cartagena in America and in the surrounding areas
          people become clever very early but they do not continue to grow in
          intelligence at the same rate. All inhabitants of the hottest zones are
          exceptionally lethargic. With so this laziness is somewhat mitigated by rule
          and force.<br>
          <br>
          When an Indian sees a European going somewhere, he thinks that he has
          something to accomplish. When he comes back, he thinks that he has already
          taken care of his business, but if he sees him going out a third time he thinks
          that he has lost his mind, as the European is going for a walk for pleasure,
          which no Indian does; he is only capable of imagining it. Indians are
          also indecisive, and both traits belong to the nations that live very far north.
          The weakening of their limbs is supposedly caused by brandy, tobacco,
          opium and other strong things. From their timidity comes superstition,
          particularly in regard to magic, and the same with jealousy. Their timidity
          makes them into slavish underlings when they have kings and evokes an
          idolatrous reverence in them, just as their laziness moves them rather to
          run around in the forest and suffer need than to be held to their labors by the
          orders of their masters.<br>
          <br>
          Montesquieu is correct in his judgment that the weak-heartedness that makes
          death so terrifying to the Indian or the Negro also makes him fear many
          things other than death that the European can withstand. The Negro slave
          from Guinea drowns himself if he is to be forced into slavery. The Indian
          women burn themselves. The Carib commits suicide at the slightest
          provocation. The Peruvian trembles in the face of an enemy, and when he is
          led to death, he is ambivalent, as though it means nothing. His awakened
          imagination, however, also makes him dare to do something but the heat of
          the moment is soon past and timidity resumes its old place again…
          The inhabitant of the temperate parts of the world, above all the central
          part, has a more beautiful body, works harder, is more jocular, more
          controlled in his passions, more intelligent than any other race of people in
          the world. That is why at all points in time these peoples have educated
          the others and controlled them with weapons. The Romans, Greeks, the
          ancient Nordic peoples, Genghis Khan, the Turks, Tamurlaine, the
          Europeans after Columbus's discoveries, they have all amazed the southern
          lands with their arts and weapons.<br>

He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism, set the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy, and continues to exercise a significant influence today in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and other fields. The fundamental idea of Kants’ “critical philosophy” — especially in his three Critiques: the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) — is human autonomy. He argues that the human understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and immortality. Therefore, scientific knowledge, morality, and religious belief are mutually consistent and secure because they all rest on the same foundation of human autonomy, which is also the final end of nature according to the teleological worldview of reflecting judgment that Kant introduces to unify the theoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system.<br><br><h3>1. Life and works</h3>Immanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in Königsberg, near the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea. [...] [D]uring Kant’s lifetime Königsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its dominant language was German. Though geographically remote from the rest of Prussia and other German cities, Königsberg was then a major commercial center, an important military port, and a relatively cosmopolitan university town.[1]<br><br>Kant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was a master harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness maker, though she was better educated than most women of her social class. Kant’s family was never destitute, but his father’s trade was in decline during Kant’s youth and his parents at times had to rely on extended family for financial support.<br><br>Kant’s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school, the Collegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism was an evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion, reliance on divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and personal devotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and introspection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching to which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response to which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to the school’s curriculum. Later the mature Kant’s emphasis on reason and autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either authority or grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against Pietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he had deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his mother, whose “genuine religiosity” he described as “not at all enthusiastic.” According to his biographer, Manfred Kuehn, Kant’s parents probably influenced him much less through their Pietism than through their artisan values of “hard work, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,” which they taught him by example.[2]<br><br>Kant attended college at the University of Königsberg, known as the Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly superseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and which encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic, metaphysics, ethics, and natural law. [...]<br><br>After college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young children outside Königsberg. By this time both of his parents had died and Kant’s finances were not yet secure enough for him to pursue an academic career. He finally returned to Königsberg in 1754 and began teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the next four decades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement from teaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two.<br><br>Kant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned from working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three scientific works — one of which, Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (1755), was a major book in which, among other things, he developed what later became known as the nebular hypothesis about the formation of the solar system. Unfortunately, the printer went bankrupt and the book had little immediate impact. To secure qualifications for teaching at the university, Kant also wrote two Latin dissertations: the first, entitled Concise Outline of Some Reflections on Fire (1755), earned him the Magister degree; and the second, New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition (1755), entitled him to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The following year he published another Latin work, The Employment in Natural Philosophy of Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which Sample I Contains the Physical Monadology (1756) [...].[3]<br><br>As an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by the students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an enormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a living. Kant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period he would lecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic, metaphysics, and ethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical geography. In his lectures Kant [...] drew on a wide range of ideas of contemporary interest. These ideas often stemmed from British sentimentalist philosophers such as David Hume (1711–1776) and Francis Hutcheson (1694–1747), some of whose texts were translated into German in the mid-1750’s; and from the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), who published a flurry of works in the early 1760’s. From early in his career Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also quickly developed a local reputation as a promising young intellectual and cut a dashing figure in Königsberg society.<br><br>After several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of publications in 1762–1764, including five philosophical works. [...].[4] [...] Finally, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime (1764) deals mainly with alleged differences in the tastes of men and women and of people from different cultures. After it was published, Kant filled his own interleaved copy of this book with (often unrelated) handwritten remarks, many of which reflect the deep influence of Rousseau on his thinking about moral philosophy in the mid-1760’s.<br><br>These works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but for the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German philosophers at the time, Kant’s early works are generally concerned with using insights from British empiricist authors to reform or broaden the German rationalist tradition without radically undermining its foundations. While some of his early works tend to emphasize rationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis. During this time Kant was striving to work out an independent position, but before the 1770’s his views remained fluid.<br><br>In 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility of metaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature philosophy. [...].<br><br>In 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in logic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen years as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a sublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the same position in 1758. [...] After Kant was finally promoted, he gradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology (Kant’s was the first such course in Germany and became very popular), rational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even mineralogy and military fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new position, Kant also wrote one more Latin dissertation: Concerning the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World (1770), which is known as the Inaugural Dissertation.<br><br>The Inaugural Dissertation departs more radically from both Wolffian rationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant’s earlier work. [...]<br><br>After 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and understanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time are subjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments are based on pure understanding (or reason) alone. [...] Kant spent a decade working on the Critique of Pure Reason and published nothing else of significance between 1770 and 1781. But its publication marked the beginning of another burst of activity that produced Kant’s most important and enduring works. Because early reviews of the Critique of Pure Reason were few and (in Kant’s judgment) uncomprehending, he tried to clarify its main points in the much shorter Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come Forward as a Science (1783). Among the major books that rapidly followed are the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Kant’s main work on the fundamental principle of morality; the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), his main work on natural philosophy in what scholars call his critical period (1781–1798); the second and substantially revised edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787); the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), a fuller discussion of topics in moral philosophy that builds on (and in some ways revises) the Groundwork; and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), which deals with aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of important essays in this period, including Idea for a Universal History With a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784) and Conjectural Beginning of Human History (1786), his main contributions to the philosophy of history; An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment? (1784), which broaches some of the key ideas of his later political essays; and What Does it Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking? (1786) [...].<br><br>With these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate German philosophy in the late 1780’s. But in 1790 he announced that the Critique of the Power of Judgment brought his critical enterprise to an end (5:170). [...] while German philosophy moved on to assess and respond to Kant’s legacy, Kant himself continued publishing important works in the 1790’s. Among these are Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), which drew a censure from the Prussian King when Kant published the book after its second essay was rejected by the censor; The Conflict of the Faculties (1798), a collection of essays inspired by Kant’s troubles with the censor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and theological faculties of the university; On the Common Saying: That May be Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice (1793), Toward Perpetual Peace (1795), and the Doctrine of Right, the first part of the Metaphysics of Morals (1797), Kant’s main works in political philosophy; the Doctrine of Virtue, the second part of the Metaphysics of Morals (1797), a catalogue of duties that Kant had been planning for more than thirty years; and Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View (1798), based on Kant’s anthropology lectures. Several other compilations of Kant’s lecture notes from other courses were published later, but these were not prepared by Kant himself.<br><br>Kant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had lived a highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his philosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind only in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a gap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural science from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a series of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric matter. These notes, known as the Opus Postumum, remained unfinished and unpublished in Kant’s lifetime, and scholars disagree on their significance and relation to his earlier work. It is clear, however, that these late notes show unmistakable signs of Kant’s mental decline, which became tragically precipitous around 1800. Kant died February 12, 1804, just short of his eightieth birthday.<br><br> 1. The best biography of Kant, on which this section draws, is Kuehn 2001.<br><br>2. Kuehn 2001, 38, 44.

            <div class=“footnote” id=“10”>Immanuel Kant uses geography and more importantly intelligence to inquire the differences in human races. Kant starts his argument on page two of the reader by implying that great heat produces strong animals and therefore Africans/black are created to situate their environment ( the heat in Africa). That is Kant basically linked Africans who by the time are called negroes to animals, this is important since, during the enlightenment era, humans are regarded superior to animals. This, therefore, makes Kant’s introduction in page two to present a bias and suspension of negative images about Africans. Kant was able to state that heat makes animals strong and also mentioned other effects in the variation of human races, that is we can tell he believes in the idea of environment and experience shaping individuals, groups and animals. It is therefore hypocritical of Kant to ignore the past experiences and the negative effects that the Trans-Atlantic-Slave trade brought to Africans, and rather insist there is no evidence of awful or substantial creation by Africans. Not to forget all those wonderful and rich civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, Ghana empire, Mali empire etc that Africans had before the Trans-Atlantic-Slave trade kicked in. Page two of the reader, therefore, presents a world together where the intellectual creation of a group of peoples is used to assert the difference between the worlds together. That is, Kant asks questions about the historical evidence and current evidence of black/African intellectual creations to make the that Africans are lesser humans.<br><br>Immanuel Kant was a major Germany Philosopher in the Enlightenment Period. His article “On the Different Races of Man” was considered one of the first attempts to give definitions of races scientifically, based on the distinction between races. The center questions on this document would be: What aspects did Kant take into account when he is giving definitions of different races? Is there any biases or discrimination in this article? What is his view on the peoples of African and American? How did he compare European to the other peoples?</div>
            <div class=“footnote” id=“11”>Immanuel Kant’s passage provides answers to the question of race. He describes different ethnicities, and attempts to provide evidence of why they differ in appearances and customs. He describes “the black color of the Negroes… to be as much the effect of a dry heat.” In the passage, Kant provides examples such as skin color to reveal the physical appearances of others, and he degrades the non-Europeans by using science to suggest how those men have flaws. Kant suggests the Arabs’ imagination is “unnatural and distorted.” He pays no respect to other cultures and deems the people as inferior to Europeans. Kant referenced Voltaire, an Enlightenment writer, who advocated equality. Although he advocated equality, “he also contended that, in practice, there would always be classes of people that commanded and classes called upon to obey… [the] thought justified European expansion overseas and new kinds of racism” (World Together, Worlds Apart 516). Kant’s reference suggests that most Europeans sought ways to justify racism, and they referenced philosophers to justify their beliefs. In this case, they saw equality as extending to one group of people, but they did not extend a globalized belief of such equality.<br><br>This passage answers two main questions ? what are the customs and characteristics of the natives in the Americas (including Canada), and what are the roles of women in cultures and societies around the world? 1. What are the customs and characteristics of the natives in the Americas (including Canada)? Kant spends a substantial paragraph in the first half of the passage answering the question above. Although he points out many negative characteristics of the natives, including their “apathy” and pride, he also details the natives’ good natures, claiming that all of them are honorable, thrill-seeking and respectful. Kant heaps special praise on native Canadians, calling them “truthful and honest” and “adventurous and enthusiastic” friends. By drawing such sweeping generalizations, Kant reduces huge groups of people into a few character traits, which are not at all representative of the populations. Kant’s writing focuses on the Enlightenment interest in classifying human beings into different racial categories, each with their own set of characteristics. He believes that certain characteristics, while not necessarily applicable to all of humanity, are at least universal within each racial category. 2. What are the roles of women in cultures and societies around the world? In the second half of the passage, Kant’s belief in the superiority of “homo europaeus” becomes evident. He claims that only Europe has found the ideal role for women ? not reducing them to mere objects, but also not allowing them much power. European women and Europeans’ treatment of women is highly moral, and therefore, ideal. The chaos of the harem in Asia and the prevalence of female slavery in Africa points to the inferiority of Asian and African culture ? Kant insinuates that Asians and Africans don’t know how to deal with their women. In Native American culture throughout the Americas, women have a substantial amount of power and are heavily involved in politics and government. Instead of praising the role of women in these societies, Kant claims that women are worse off ? not only do they have to deal with the responsibilities of the home and family life, they also have to “shoulder the burdens” of men’s work. Kant does not acknowledge the positive aspects in any culture’s treatment of women but his own. In fact, Kant refers to all non-Europeans as “savages” throughout this passage, relying heavily on the Enlightenment idea that only Europeans rely on logic and reason to govern themselves; all others base their policies and ideals on whims and fancy. Kant’s universalizing and stereotyping only serves to confirm the Enlightenment idea of the superiority of “homo europaeus” over the rest of the world.</div>
            <div class=“footnote” id=“12”>Immanuel Kant adopts a biased, judgmental tone when writing of the different races, describing Indians as having a taste for the “grotesque”, the Japanese as “stubborn” and Africans as having “trifling” feelings, among other comments (Page 2). The language he uses firmly emphasizes Kant’s opinions and thoughts. He writes of, what he believes are, personality traits of other races and their supposed shortcomings, displaying an opinionated and superior attitude (”He is hospitable…and distorted images…” / “The blacks are very vain…thrashings”). Kant clearly thinks himself to be right ? he is confident and does not hedge, using the present tense to imply universality, and his surety in the accuracy of his statements and absolutist language (”…the Arabs are…” / “…the Indians have…”). Though presented as facts, his words lack sources or bases for their origin. As a white, European man, Kant’s perspective is colored by his background, and seems to emphasize a belief in the superiority in the white race. He uses very harsh language when writing of Africans, comparing them to “animals,” calling them “lazy, soft and dawdling,” and writing that being “black” was clear proof that someone was “stupid.” His work sharply displays an absence of cultural relativism or understanding as he looks down on the traditions and practices of other cultures or races (idols, paintings, etc.) Kant also attempts to justify his observations with “proof” to, presumably, pre-empt any criticism of the veracity or accuracy of his statements: Indians are grotesque because of their idols and practices; they are “yellow” because of a continuous gall excretion (Page 2). Furthermore, he cites other famed writers and thinkers such as Voltaire and Hume (Page 2), perhaps to draw parallels between their works that he apparently respects and concurs with and his own, or, perhaps to lend greater credence to his own insights by comparing it to highly regarded prior material.<br><br>1. While attempting to explain the way Immanuel Kant would define Enlightenment, this would be necessary address his writings. The experts from these writings are included in page 3 of the assigned document and refer to Kant’s interpretation of the established people’s different surmises as the result of their attention to the chain of the natural causes. Alike, the prominent philosopher elaborates on the different human races those fact of existence is also the result of the particular geographical and genetic links. Consequently, keeping in mind Kant’s examples on how the black-skinned and Asian races shaped, this appears that the author of the assigned document would point to the natural impacts and occurrences as the primary features of Enlightenment. Similarly, I predict that Kant would define Enlightenment as the scientific current designed to explore people’s abilities to adaptation. In this context, the philosopher’s scientific views are similar to those Charles Darwin used as the foundations for his Theory of Evolution. Further, based on the experts from the scholar’s philosophical writings, in my opinion, Kant would define Enlightenment as the shift towards eliminating people’s established visions of the social phenomena. Among these, people’s understanding of shaping the human races appears to be the major one in this context. From this, Enlightenment is making the society aware of how the things really work. While interpreting Kant’s thoughts present in the assigned document, this appears that the significant part of these is devoted to elaborating on the racial stereotypes. Kant points to the climate conditions as the primary reason for the differences between the races and emphasizes that God has created all people to be equal. All in all, from Kant’s perspective, Enlightenment is the scientific current intended to deprive the society of the stereotypes regarding different social phenomena. 2. While considering the universality and limitations of the principles and values of those ideas the philosopher described in the assigned document, this is primarily needed to address Kant’s descriptions of formation the different races and the natural occurrences accompanying this process. The fact that he points to the climate and geographical differences between the different regions in the world as the driving forces for why some populations are different comparing to the others is, on the one hand, unproven and, on the other hand, the fact that in the contemporary globalized world, the African-Americans living in the North of the United States and are not keeping experiencing the physical transformations points to the limits of such an approach. However, Kant’s explanations of the habit diseases the Indian and Chinese men are exposed to are the universal idea. The author’s careful attention to the preconditions of the Indians’ swollen livers and congested gall-bladders appears to be a relevant and universal factor. Eventually, I have found Kant’s arguments for a need of changing people’s perception of wrong established and stereotypical visions of the racial inequality to be also universal. Though the philosopher founds his arguments upon the religious considerations, the fact remains to be same. The point is all the populations, nationalities, ethnic communities, and races are equal independently of the color of their skin and their social status. This idea serves the most strong argument to restrain the racial tensions in the contemporary world. Alike, this argument is probably the most persuasive one among those shared today.</div>
            <div class=“footnote” id=“13”>The context behind Immanuel Kant’s “On the Different Races of Man” (1775), particularly that of the first page of the text, begins with the background of the author himself. Kant lived from April 22, 1724 ? February 12, 1804, making significant contributions to the field of philosophy during that time (Wikipedia). Identifying the context of this piece continues with what was happening in the world during this time and how those topics connect to the themes and ideas presented in this text. A big idea introduced around the time of Kant’s writings, particularly this piece, was scientific racism. This concept is defined as “the study of techniques and hypotheses in order to support or justify the belief in racism, racial inferiority, or racial superiority” (Wikipedia). Kant’s piece “On the Different Races of Man” related to this idea of scientific racism in its proposal of the ide that racial distinctions are not due to change but are due to a natural purpose. Quotes from the text such as, “We have connected four human races under which all the manifold variations of this genus are supposed to the conceived” and statements involving racial specifications support these ideas. I believe the principles presented in this text to actually demonstrate a very limited mindset rather than a universal one. Consciously and consistently feeling the need to specify and distinguish based on race is a significant setback and a strong demonstration that one cannot see past physical characteristics. While this is likely not the intention of Kant and it is logical in a piece of this style to include racial descriptions, to me it just seems counterintuitive ? if one is trying to move past racism, why specify race?<br><br>At first, the passage brings up slave trade into America. White superiority is depicted for fine-looking and hard working slaves are “gifts (that) earn respect in the world(line 6)”.  The writer gives a great tribute to the savages in northern American for “They have a strong feeling for honor, and as in quest of it they seek wild adventures hundreds of miles abroad(line 27)”. Savages regard the beauty of “moral understanding” and “generous forgiveness of an injury” as “miserable cowardice”. After a debate of women’s power in a family between Father Labat and writer, the writer comes up with a comment that Canadian female is given more “humble respect”. Based on my reading, the author would define enlightenment as a liberation of female power and slave power since, in the passage, the author points out the fine morality of slave and women in north America. To illustrate this, the writer argues that “there a woman is always in a prison,” while “a despairing man is always a strict master”.</div>
            <div class=“footnote” id=“14”>The main thing that appears to be missing in Kant’s musings on race is any positive characteristic of South Asian and African people. There is a striking inconsistency to the way he describes the various “races” of the world, as Europeans saw it at the time. He praises Arabs for their nobility, Persians for their liberal approach to Islam, and the Japanese for their “resoluteness,” among many negative aspects as well But when it comes to Indians and Africans, he has little good to say. He repeats the adjective “grotesque” when referring to South Asian cultural practices, and describes “the Negro” as lazy and without talent (2). This suggests a few things. First, that Europeans dislike races that have particularly dark skin. Kant does not dwell on the physical features of the Arabs, Persians, or Japanese, but spends an entire long paragraph discussing the details of Indian skin. There also seems to be an implicit connection between the darkness of African skin and Africans’ perceived inferiority from Kant’s perspective, which actually undercuts his supposed logic as an Enlightenment thinker. He implies that Africans are strong but incapable of rational thought, when in reality this is a rather irrational argument that does not go further than skin deep. This of course demonstrates the very rigid limits of Enlightenment thought. While his perceptions of Middle Eastern and East Asian cultures are not necessarily totally egalitarian in nature, he at least recognizes some positive aspect of each one, which illustrates that there was certainly a progressive side to the movement. But his dismissal of Indians and Africans as inferior, which appears to be based on nothing more than his opinions and limited worldview, counteract the positives completely. To be fair though, his disgust at wife-burning in India is fair, from basically any perspective, since at some point being culturally inclusive must be reconciled with the most basic morality. Wife-burning is not only misogynistic but also torturous and murderous,so his dismissal of this practice in particular is actually not out of line, but his interpretation of Indian art as barbaric and disgusting of course is exactly that by modern standards. It is rather eye-opening to the bigoted side of one of history’s most praised philosophers.<br><br>Kant does not provide his resources concerning his thoughts on race and human organization. Kant, a philosopher who traveled rarely, needed to have read works that enforced these racist ideas. He writes that “in short, this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that he was stupid” confidently (3). However, Kant does not give texts or evidence from which he gained his opinions. This may be due widespread acceptance in European countries of the racist categorizing of humans that Kant is propagating here. He does not feel the need to support the claims he is making because it is already considered proven. Kant also does not delve into the ethical questions concerning slavery and the treatment of slaves. He addresses the reality of slavery, but not the treatment that is involved with it. However, on this same page, Kant critiques the culture of the “Orient” due to the morality of sexuality. He believes that those who are unable to unite “the morally beautiful” with their “impulses” are ultimately acting unethical in sexual acts (3). Kant writes extensively on ethics, (his categorical imperative) yet does not extend his thoughts to slavery. Kant and other Enlightenment era philosophers define the Enlightenment as using pure reason to pursue unlimited knowledge; they believe that man is able to know everything if they think in a rational manner. Therefore, as evidenced here, intelligence is a critical value to them. Those who are deemed less intelligent at the time (people of color, women), are isolated from the intellectual community and are treated as inferiors.  One can say that Kant is correct in that intelligence is a virtue and a society benefits from the pursuit of knowledge. In this manner, his writings contain universal values. However, on this page his ideas concerning different races are very limited. They are taken from a euro-centric point of view. The Enlightenment as a whole perpetuated euro-centric ideals, harmfully legitimizing racist and sexist beliefs by bringing them into the realm of “rational thought.”</div>
            
 <div class=“footnote” id=“34”>“Of course it matters in evaluating Kant’s views what conclusions they might lead to on these subjects. But often critics are less interested in this question (which may be difficult to decide) than in interpreting Kant’s opinions as expressions of the kind of person he was, and in using our reactions to his character to color our reception of his philosophy. On some of these topics, the common image of Kant is all too accurate, while on others it is exaggerated and distorted. He was, however, an ardent supporter of the movement known as “Enlightenment” and his views on many subjects – politics, education, and especially religion – were on the whole quite progressive by the standards of the time. It is also remarkable that critics who typically attack others for failing to consider things in social and historical context often feel free to measure Kant’s opinions by the same standards they would use to judge views voiced by someone living in our own day.”(19)<br><br>“Kant is sometimes also criticized for the views on race that are expressed in some of his anthropology lectures and shorter essays. Here too there is sometimes distortion or exaggeration.”(20)<br><br>“It is a sometimes uncomfortable fact that the philosophers of the past whose thoughts we study with most profit were not especially fine human beings. The only way to deal with this fact is to face up squarely to the cognitive dissonance it occasions and then to resolve to set it aside as irrelevant to anything that could be of legitimate interest in deciding which philosophers to study. It displays a deplorable misunderstanding of what philosophy is – and what may be gained by studying it – to treat past philosophers as gurus at whose feet we are to sit in order to absorb their wisdom, or alternatively, to find in their unattractive personal traits and characteristics an excuse for not studying them at all.”(20)<br><br>“ If a past philosopher, Kant for instance, was an admirable person, that still gives us no reason to study his philosophical thoughts if they were unoriginal or mediocre and do not repay our careful investigation and critical reflection. If the philosopher was a thoroughly unattractive character, or even if some of his opinions on morality or politics offend enlightened people today, it may still be true that his contributions to philosophy are indispensable to our understanding of philosophical problems and of the history of people’s reflections on them. If we study the writings of the admirable philosopher in order to honor his virtuous character, then we are merely wasting time and effort that could have been better employed.”(20)<br><br>“By the same token, if we refuse to study the writings of the personally repulsive philosopher either because we think our neglect justly punishes him for his misdeeds or his evil opinions, or because we want to avoid being influenced by such a pernicious character, then all we accomplish by this foolish exercise in self-righteousness and closedmindedness is to deprive ourselves of what we might have learned both from attaining to his insights and from exposing his errors. It is always sad to see philosophy students, and sometimes even professional philosophers, missing out on many things they might have learned on account of their moral or political approval or disapproval of the personality or opinions of some long-dead philosopher, who is far beyond their poor power to reward or punish. The only people we punish in this way are ourselves, and also those around us, or in the future, whom we might have influenced for the better if we had educated ourselves more wisely.”(20)</div>

            <div class=“footnote” id=“36”>“Kant’s writings do exhibit many private prejudices and contradictory tendencies … But Kant’s theory is fortunately stronger than his prejudices, and it is the theory on which philosopher should focus. We should not hide or suppress the prejudices, but neither should we overvalue them or try to inflate them into something they are not… The prejudices are not centrally connected to the defining feature of his theory of human moral development.” (105)</div>
