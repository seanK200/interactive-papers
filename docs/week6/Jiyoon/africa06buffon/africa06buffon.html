          <p>
            America is not less singular for the uniformity in the figure and
            <a>colour of its inhabitants</a>, than Africa is remarkable for the
            variety of men it contains. This part of the world is very ancient,
            and very populous. The climate is extremely hot; and yet the
            temperature of the air differs widely in different nations. Their
            manners also are not less various, as appears from the description I
            have given of them. All these causes have concurred in producing a
            greater variety of men in this quarter of the globe than in any
            other; for in examining the differences of temperature in the
            countries of Africa, we find, that in Barbary and all the regions
            adjacent to the Mediterranean, the men are white, and only a little
            tawny; this whole tract of country is refreshed, on one hand, by the
            air of the Mediterranean Sea, and by the snows on Mount Atlas, on
            the other; it is, besides, situated in the Temperate zone. on this
            side of the Tropic. All the natives, likewise, from Egypt to the
            Canary islands, are only more or less tawny. Beyond the Tropic, and
            on the other side of Mount Atlas, the heat becomes much greater, and
            the inhabitants are very brown, but not entirely black. When we
            come, however, to the 17th or 18th degree of north latitude, under
            which Senegal and Nubia are situated, the heat is excessive, and the
            natives are perfectly black. At Senegal the liquor in the
            thermometer rises to 38 degrees, while it seldom rises to 30 in
            France, and never exceeds 25 in Peru, though it be situated under
            the Torrid Zone. In Nubia we have no observations made with the
            thermometer; but all travellers agree in declaring the heat to be
            excessive. The sandy deserts between Upper Egypt and Nubia heat the
            air to such a degree that the north wind must be extremely scorching
            in that country. Besides, as the east wind, which generally blows
            between the Tropics, arrives not at Nubia till it has traversed
            Arabia, it is not surprising to find the natives very black; it is
            less surprising to see the inhabitants of Senegal perfectly black;
            for the east wind before it reaches them, must blow over the whole
            of Africa in its great breadth, which renders the heat of the air
            almost insupportable. Taking, therefore, the whole of Africa
            situated between the Tropics, where the east wind blows most
            constantly, we may easily conceive why the western coasts of this
            pan of the globe should and actually do suffer a greater degree of
            heat than the eastern coasts; for this wind arrives at the eastern
            coasts with a freshness which it acquires by traversing a vast sea;
            but, on the other hand, before it arrives at the western coasts it
            acquires a scorching heat by blowing across the interior regions of
            Africa. It is for this reason that the coasts of Senegal, Sierra,
            Sierra-Leona, Guiana, and all the western parts of Africa situated
            under the Tropics, are the hottest climates on the globe. It is not
            near so hot on the eastern coasts as at Mozambique, Mombaza, etc. I
            cannot. therefore, hesitate in ascribing to this reason the cause of
            our finding true Negroes, or the blackest men on the western
            territories of Africa, and Caffres, or men of a less deep blackness
            on the eastern coasts. The difference between these two kinds of
            blacks, which is very apparent, proceeds from the heat of the
            climate, which is not very hot in the eastern parts, but excessive
            on the western. Beyond the Tropic on the south, the heat
            considerably diminishes, both on account of the higher latitude, and
            because the point of Africa begins to turn narrow; and this point of
            land, being surrounded by the sea, receives fresher breezes than if
            it had been in the midst of a continent. The natives also of this
            country begin to whiten, and are naturally more white than black, as
            was formerly remarked. Nothing can prove more clearly that the
            climate is the principal cause of the varieties of mankind, than
            this colour of the Hottentots, whose blackness could not be
            diminished but by the temperature of the climate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will be the more confirmed in this opinion, if we examine the
            other people who live under the Tropics to the east of Africa. The
            inhabitants of the Maldiva islands, of Ceylon, of the point of the
            Indian Peninsula, of Sumatra, of Malacca, of Borneo, of Celebes, of
            the Philippine islands, etc. are all very brown, without being
            absolutely black; because all these territories are either islands
            or peninsulas. The sea in these climates has a great effect in
            tempering the air; and besides, the east and west winds, which blow
            alternately in this part of the globe, pass over a vast extent of
            sea, before they arrive at this Archipelago. Thus all these islands
            are peopled with brown men, <a>because</a> the heat is not
            excessive. But in New Guinea we find blacks, who, from the
            descriptions of voyagers, appear to be <a>real Negroes</a>; because,
            in this country, which extends far to the east as to form a kind of
            continent, the wind which traverses it is much hotter than that
            which prevails in the Indian ocean. In New Holland, which is not so
            hot a climate, the natives are less black, and very similar to the
            Hottentots. Do not these Negroes and Hottentots, who live so remote
            from the other people distinguished by that appellation, prove that
            their colour depends on the heat of the climate? No communication
            can ever be supposed to have taken place between Africa and this
            southern continent; and yet we find there the same species of men,
            because the same circumstances concur in producing the same degree
            of heat. An example taken from the other animals will still farther
            confirm what has been advanced. It has been remarked, that, in the
            province of Dauphiny, all the swine are black, but that in Vivarais,
            on the other side of all Rhone, where it is colder than in Dauphiny,
            all these animals are white. It is not probable that the inhabitants
            of one of these two provinces would agree to raise only black swine,
            and the other only white swine. It appears to me, that this
            phenomenon is owing to the different temperature of the climates,
            combined perhaps with the manner of feeding these animals.
          </p>

          <p>
            The few blacks who are found in the Philippines, and some other
            islands of the Indian ocean, are probably derived from the Papous or
            Negroes of New Guinea, with which the Europeans have been acquainted
            for these last 50 years only. Dampier, in the year 1700, discovered
            the most eastern parts of this country, to which he gave the name of
            New Britain; but its extent is still unknown; we only know that
            those parts of it which have been discovered seem to be thinly
            inhabited.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus it appears that
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Q1"
              >the existence of Negroes is confined to those parts of the earth
              where all the necessary circumstances concur in producing a
              constant and an excessive heat</a
            >. This heat is so necessary, not only to the production, but even
            to the preservation of Negroes, that it has been remarked in our
            islands, where the heat, though great, is not comparable to that of
            Senegal, that the Negro infants are so liable to be affected by
            impressions from the air, that the proprietors are obliged to keep
            them, for the first nine days after birth, in dose warm chambers. If
            these precautions be neglected, and the children exposed to the air
            immediately after birth, they are liable to be affected with a
            tetanus or locked jaw, which proves fatal, because it deprives them
            of the power of taking nourishment. M. Littre, who dissected a Negro
            in the year 1702, remarked, that the end of the glans, which was not
            covered with the prepuce, was black, and that the part of it which
            was covered was perfectly white. This observation demonstrates that
            the air is necessary to produce the blackness of Negroes. Their
            children are born white, or rather red, like those of other men. But
            two or three days after their colour changes to a yellowish tawny,
            which grows gradually darker till the seventh or eighth day, when
            they are totally black. It is well known, that all children, two or
            three days after birth, are affected with a kid of <a>jaundice</a>,
            which among white people soon passes off and leaves no impression;
            but in Negroes, on the contrary, it gives an indelible colour to the
            skin, which becomes always more and more black. M. Kolbe remarks,
            that he has seen Hottentot children, who were born as white as the
            Europeans, become olive in consequence of this jaundice, and the
            impressions of the air, however, are only the occasional, and not
            the primary causes of blackness; for it has been observed, that the
            children of Negroes, as soon as they come into the world, have black
            genitals, and a black spot at the root of their nails. The action of
            the air and the jaundice may perhaps help to expand this colour; but
            it is certain, that the rudiments of blackness are communicated to
            them by their parents; that, in whatever part of the world a Negro
            is brought forth, he will be equally black as if he had been born in
            his own country; and that if there is any difference in the first
            generation, it is so small as not to be perceptible. This fact,
            however, implies not that the colour will continue the same after
            many successive generations. On the contrary, there are many reasons
            for presuming, that as this colour is originally the effect of a
            long continued heat, it will be gradually effaced by the temperature
            of a cold climate; and, consequently, that if a colony of Negroes
            were transplanted into a northern province, their descendants of the
            eighth, tenth, or twelth generation would be much fairer, and
            perhaps as white as the natives of that climate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anatomists have inquired into the seat of this black colour. Some of
            them allege, that it neither resides in the skin nor scarf-skin, but
            in the cellular membrane between them; that this membrane, after
            long maceration in hot water, retains its original blackness; but
            that the skin and scarf-skin appear to be as white as those of other
            men. Dr Town, and some others have maintained, that the blood of the
            Negroes is black, and that their blackness originates entirely from
            their blood. I am much inclined to believe this fact; for I have
            observed, that among us the blood of those persons who have tawny,
            yellowish, or brown complexions, is blacker than that of those who
            are fairer. M. Barrere, who seems to have examined this subject most
            minutely, tells us, and Mr Winslow agrees with him, that the
            scarf-skin of Negroes is black; and though its extreme thinness and
            transparency may make it appear white, that it is really as bla k as
            the blackest horn, when reduced to the same degree of thinness. They
            also assure us, that the skin of Negroes is of a reddish brown
            colour, approaching to black. This colour of the Negroes, according
            to Barrere, is produced by their bile, which he affirms, from
            several dissections he made in Cayenne, instead of yellow, to be as
            black as ink. The bile, when absorbed and dispersed through the
            body, tinges the skin of white people yellow; and if it were black,
            it would probably produce a black colour. But as soon as the
            effusion of the bile ceases, the skin resumes its natural whiteness.
            We must therefore suppose that the bile of the Negroes is
            perpetually effused, or as Barrere alleges, that it is so abundant
            as to be naturally secreted in the scarf-skin, and to tinge it of a
            black colour. Upon the whole it is probable, that both the bile and
            blood of Negroes are browner than those of white people, as their
            skin is likewise blacker. But one of these facts cannot be admitted
            to prove the cause of the other; for if the blackness of the blood
            or bile be allowed to give the same colour to the skin, then instead
            of demanding why the skin of Negroes is black, we ought to ask why
            their blood or their bile is of that colour? This species of false
            reasoning, in place of solving the question, renders it still more
            intricate. To me it has always appeared, that the same cause which
            makes our complexions brown, after being exposed to the action of
            the air, and to the rays of the sun, which renders the Spaniards
            more brown than the French, and the Moors than the Spaniards, also
            renders the Negroes blacker than the Moors. Besides, I am not here
            inquiring how this cause acts;
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="Q2">
              I only mean to ascertain that it does act, and that its effects
              are more perceptible in proportion to its strength and time of
              acting.</a

          paint himself as differnt.
