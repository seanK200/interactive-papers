              America is not less singular for the uniformity in the figure and colour of its
              inhabitants, than Africa is remarkable for the variety of men it contains. This
              part of the world is very ancient, and very populous. The climate is extremely
              hot; and yet the temperature of the air differs widely in different nations.
              Their manners also are not less various, as appears from the description I
              have given of them. All these causes have concurred in producing a greater
              variety of men in this quarter of the globe than in any other; for in examining
              the differences of temperature in the countries of Africa, we find, that in
              Barbary and all the regions adjacent to the Mediterranean, the men are white,
              and only a little tawny; this whole tract of country is refreshed, on one hand,
              by the air of the Mediterranean Sea, and by the snows on Mount Atlas, on the
              other; it is, besides, situated in the Temperate zone. on this side of the Tropic.
              All the natives, likewise, from Egypt to the Canary islands, are only more or
              less tawny. Beyond the Tropic, and on the other side of Mount Atlas, the
              heat becomes much greater, and the inhabitants are very brown, but not
              entirely black. When we come, however, to the 17th or 18th degree of north
              latitude, under which Senegal and Nubia are situated, the heat is excessive,
              and the natives are perfectly black. At Senegal the liquor in the thermometer
              rises to 38 degrees, while it seldom rises to 30 in France, and never exceeds
              25 in Peru, though it be situated under the Torrid Zone. In Nubia we have no
              observations made with the thermometer; but all travellers agree in declaring
              the heat to be excessive. The sandy deserts between Upper Egypt and Nubia
              heat the air to such a degree that the north wind must be extremely scorching
              in that country. Besides, as the east wind, which generally blows between the
              Tropics, arrives not at Nubia till it has traversed Arabia, it is not surprising to
              find the natives very black; it is less surprising to see the inhabitants of
              Senegal perfectly black; for the east wind before it reaches them, must blow
              over the whole of Africa in its great breadth, which renders the heat of the
              air almost insupportable. Taking, therefore, the whole of Africa situated
              between the Tropics, where the east wind blows most constantly, we may
              easily conceive why the western coasts of this pan of the globe should and
              actually do suffer a greater degree of heat than the eastern coasts; for this
              wind arrives at the eastern coasts with a freshness which it acquires by
              traversing a vast sea; but, on the other hand, before it arrives at the
              western coasts it acquires a scorching heat by blowing across the
              interior regions of Africa. It is for this reason that the coasts of
              Senegal, Sierra, Sierra-Leona, Guiana, and all the western parts of
              Africa situated under the Tropics, are the hottest climates on the globe. It is
              not near so hot on the eastern coasts as at Mozambique, Mombaza, etc. I
              cannot. therefore, hesitate in ascribing to this reason the cause of our finding
              true Negroes, or the blackest men on the western territories of Africa, and
              Caffres, or men of a less deep blackness on the eastern coasts. The difference
              between these two kinds of blacks, which is very apparent, proceeds from the
              heat of the climate, which is not very hot in the eastern parts, but excessive
              on the western. Beyond the Tropic on the south, the heat considerably
              diminishes, both on account of the higher latitude, and because the point of
              Africa begins to turn narrow; and this point of land, being surrounded by
              the sea, receives fresher breezes than if it had been in the midst of a
              continent. The natives also of this country begin to whiten, and are
              naturally more white than black, as was formerly remarked. Nothing can
              prove more clearly that the climate is the principal cause of the varieties of
              mankind, than this colour of the Hottentots, whose blackness could not be
              diminished but by the temperature of the climate.<br>
              <br>
              We will be the more confirmed in this opinion, if we examine the other
              people who live under the Tropics to the east of Africa. The inhabitants of the
              Maldiva islands, of Ceylon, of the point of the Indian Peninsula, of Sumatra,
              of Malacca, of Borneo, of Celebes, of the Philippine islands, etc. are all very
              brown, without being absolutely black; because all these territories are
              either islands or peninsulas. The sea in these climates has a great effect in
              tempering the air; and besides, the east and west winds, which blow
              alternately in this part of the globe, pass over a vast extent of sea, before they
              arrive at this Archipelago. Thus all these islands are peopled with brown
              men, because the heat is not excessive. But in New Guinea we find blacks,
              who, from the descriptions of voyagers, appear to be real Negroes; because,
              in this country, which extends far to the east as to form a kind of continent,
              the wind which traverses it is much hotter than that which prevails in the
              Indian ocean. In New Holland, which is not so hot a climate, the natives are
              less black, and very similar to the Hottentots. Do not these Negroes and
              Hottentots, who live so remote from the other people distinguished by that
              appellation, prove that their colour depends on the heat of the climate?
              No communication can ever be supposed to have taken place between Africa
              and this southern continent; and yet we find there the same species of men,
              because the same circumstances concur in producing the same degree of heat.
              An example taken from the other animals will still farther confirm what has
              been advanced. It has been remarked, that, in the province of Dauphiny, all
              the swine are black, but that in Vivarais, on the other side of all Rhone,
              where it is colder than in Dauphiny, all these animals are white. It is not
              probable that the inhabitants of one of these two provinces would agree to
              raise only black swine, and the other only white swine. It appears to me,
              that this phenomenon is owing to the different temperature of the climates,
              combined perhaps with the manner of feeding these animals.<br>
              <br>
              The few blacks who are found in the Philippines, and some other islands of
              the Indian ocean, are probably derived from the Papous or Negroes of New
              Guinea, with which the Europeans have been acquainted for these last 50
              years only. Dampier, in the year 1700, discovered the most eastern parts of
              this country, to which he gave the name of New Britain; but its extent is
              still unknown; we only know that those parts of it which have
              been discovered seem to be thinly inhabited.<br>
              <br>
              Thus it appears that the existence of Negroes is confined to those parts of the
              earth where all the necessary circumstances concur in producing a constant
              and an excessive heat. This heat is so necessary, not only to the production,
              but even to the preservation of Negroes, that it has been remarked in our
              islands, where the heat, though great, is not comparable to that of Senegal,
              that the Negro infants are so liable to be affected by impressions from the air,
              that the proprietors are obliged to keep them, for the first nine days after
              birth, in dose warm chambers. If these precautions be neglected, and the
              children exposed to the air immediately after birth, they are liable to be
              affected with a tetanus or locked jaw, which proves fatal, because it
              deprives them of the power of taking nourishment. M. Littre, who dissected
              a Negro in the year 1702, remarked, that the end of the glans, which was not
              covered with the prepuce, was black, and that the part of it which was
              covered was perfectly white. This observation demonstrates that the air is
              necessary to produce the blackness of Negroes. Their children are born
              white, or rather red, like those of other men. But two or three days after their
              colour changes to a yellowish tawny, which grows gradually darker till the
              seventh or eighth day, when they are totally black. It is well known, that all
              children, two or three days after birth, are affected with a kid of jaundice,
              which among white people soon passes off and leaves no impression;
              but in Negroes, on the contrary, it gives an indelible colour to the skin,
              which becomes always more and more black. M. Kolbe remarks, that he has
              seen Hottentot children, who were born as white as the Europeans, become
              olive in consequence of this jaundice, and the impressions of the air,
              however, are only the occasional, and not the primary causes of blackness;
              for it has been observed, that the children of Negroes, as soon as they come
              into the world, have black genitals, and a black spot at the root of their nails.
              The action of the air and the jaundice may perhaps help to expand this colour;
              but it is certain, that the rudiments of blackness are communicated to them by
              their parents; that, in whatever part of the world a Negro is brought forth, he
              will be equally black as if he had been born in his own country; and that if
              there is any difference in the first generation, it is so small as not to
              be perceptible. This fact, however, implies not that the colour will continue
              the same after many successive generations. On the contrary, there are many
              reasons for presuming, that as this colour is originally the effect of a long
              continued heat, it will be gradually effaced by the temperature of a cold
              climate; and, consequently, that if a colony of Negroes were transplanted
              into a northern province, their descendants of the eighth, tenth, or twelfth
              generation would be much fairer, and perhaps as white as the natives of that
              climate.<br>
              <br>
              Anatomists have inquired into the seat of this black colour. Some of them
              allege, that it neither resides in the skin nor scarf-skin, but in the cellular
              membrane between them; that this membrane, after long maceration in hot
              water, retains its original blackness; but that the skin and scarf-skin appear to
              be as white as those of other men. Dr Town, and some others
              have maintained, that the blood of the Negroes is black, and that
              their blackness originates entirely from their blood. I am much inclined to
              believe this fact; for I have observed, that among us the blood of those
              persons who have tawny, yellowish, or brown complexions, is blacker than
              that of those who are fairer. M. Barrere, who seems to have examined this
              subject most minutely, tells us, and Mr Winslow agrees with him, that the
              scarf-skin of Negroes is black; and though its extreme thinness and
              transparency may make it appear white, that it is really as bla k as the
              blackest horn, when reduced to the same degree of thinness. They also
              assure us, that the skin of Negroes is of a reddush brown colour,
              approaching to black. This colour of the Negroes, according to Barrere, is
              produced by their bile, which he affirms, from several dissections he made in
              Cayenne, instead of yellow, to be as black as ink. The bile, when absorbed
              and dispersed through the body, tinges the skin of white people yellow; and
              if it were black, it would probably produce a black colour. But as soon as the
              effusion of the bile ceases, the skin resumes its natural whiteness. We must
              therefore suppose that the bile of the Negroes is perpetually effused, or as 
              Barrere alleges, that it is so abundant as to be naturally secreted in the scarfskin,
              and to tinge it of a black colour. Upon the whole it is probable, that both
              the bile and blood of Negroes are browner than those of white people, as their
              skin is likewise blacker. But one of these facts cannot be admitted to prove
              the cause of the other; for if the blackness of the blood or bile be allowed to
              give the same colour to the skin, then instead of demanding why the skin of
              Negroes is black, we ought to ask why their blood or their bile is of that
              colour? This species of false reasoning, in place of solving the question,
              renders it still more intricate. To me it has always appeared, that the same
              cause which makes our complexions brown, after being exposed to the action
              of the air, and to the rays of the sun, which renders the
              Negroes blacker than the Moors. Besides, I am not here inquiring how this
              cause acts; I only mean to ascertain that it does act, and that its effects are
              more perceptible in proportion to its strength and time of acting.

Buffon published thirty-six quarto volumes of his Histoire Naturelle during his lifetime; with additional volumes based on his notes and further research being published in the two decades following his death. Ernst Mayr wrote that "Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century."
