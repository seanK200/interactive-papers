            <hr />
            <br />
            <br />
            Man, when he enters the world, is naturally led to enquire who he
            is; whence he comes; whither he is going; for what purpose he is
            created; and by whose benevolence he is preserved. He finds himself
            descended from the remotest creation; journeying to a life of
            perfection and happiness, and led by his endowments to a
            contemplation of the works of nature.
            <br />
            <br />
            Like other animals who enjoy life, sensation, and perception, seek
            for food, amusements, and rest, and who prepare habitations
            convenient for their kind, he is curious and inquisitive; but, above
            all other animals, he is noble in his nature, in as much as, by the
            powers of his mind, he is able to reason justly upon whatever
            discovers itself to his senses; and to look, with reverence and
            wonder, upon the works of Him who created all things.
            <br />
            <br />
            That existence is purely contemptible, which regards only the
            Ratification of infinitive wants, and the preservation of a body
            made to perish. It is therefore the business of a thinking being, to
            look forward to the purposes of all things; and to remember that the
            end of creation is, that God may be glorified in all his works.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hence it is of importance that we should study the works of nature,
            than which, what could be more useful, what more interesting? For,
            however large a portion of them lies open to our present view, a
            still greater part is yet unknown and undiscovered.
            <br />
            <br />
            All things are not within the immediate reach of human capacity.
            Many have been made known to us, of which those who went before were
            ignorant; many we have heard of, but know not what they are; and
            many must remain for the diligence of future ages.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is the exclusive property of man, to contemplate and to reason on
            the great book of nature. She gradually unfolds herself to him who,
            with patience and perseverance, will search into her mysteries; and
            when the memory of the present and of past generations shall be
            entirely obliterated he shall enjoy the high privilege of living in
            the minds of his successors, as he has been advanced in the dignity
            of his nature, by the labours of those who went before him.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Universe comprehends whatever exists; whatever can come to our
            knowledge by the agency of our senses. The Stars, the Elements, and
            this our Globe.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Stars are bodies remote, lucid, revolving in perpetual motion.
            They shine either by their own proper light, as the Sun, and the
            remoter fixed Stars; or are Planets receiving light from stars. Of
            these the primary planets are solar:
            <i>
              Saturn, Jupiter, Mars; the Earth, Venus, Mercury, and Georgium
              Sidus
            </i>
            ; the secondary are those subservient to, and rolling around the
            primary, as the Moon around the earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Elements are simple bodies constituting the atmosphere and
            probably filling the spaces between the stars.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fire: lucid, resilient, warm, evolant, vivifying.
            <br />
            Air: transparent, elastic, dry, encirculating, generating.
            <br />
            Water: diaphanous, fluid, moist, gliding, conceiving.
            <br />
            Earth: opaque, fixed, cold, quiescent, sterile.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Earth is a planetary sphere, turning around its own axis, once
            in 24 hours, and around the sun once a year; surrounded by an
            atmosphere of elements, and covered by a stupendous crust of natural
            bodies, which are the object of our studies. It is terraqueous
            having the depressed parts covered with waters, the elevated parts
            gradually dilated into dry and habitable continents. The
            <i>
              land
            </i>
            is moistened by
            <i>
              vapours
            </i>
            , which rising from the waters, are collected into
            <i>
              clouds
            </i>
            ; these are deposited upon the tops of mountains; form small
            <i>
              streams
            </i>
            , which unite into rivulets, and reunite into these ever- flowing
            rivers, which pervading the thirsty earth, and affording moisture to
            the productions growing for the support of her living inhabitants
            are at last returned into their parent sea.
            <br />
            <br />
            The study of natural history is simple, beautiful, and instructive
            in the collection, arrangement, and exhibition of the various
            productions of the earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are divided into the three grand kingdoms of nature, whose
            boundaries meet together in the Zoophytes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Minerals inhabit the interior parts of the earth in rude and
            shapeless masses; are generated by salts, mixed together
            promiscuously and shaped fortuitously.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are bodies concrete, without life or sensation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Vegetables clothe the surface with verdure, imbibe nourishment
            through bibulous roots, breathe by quivering leaves, celebrate their
            nuptials in a genial metamorphosis, and continue their kind by the
            dispersion of seed within prescribed limits.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are bodies
            <i>
              organized, and have life
            </i>
            and not sensation. Animals adorn the exterior parts of the earth,
            respire, and generate eggs; are impelled to action by hunger,
            congeneric affections, and pain; and by preying on other animals and
            vegetables, restrain with proper proportion the numbers of both.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are bodies organized, and have life, sensation, and the power
            of locomotion. Man, the last and best of created works, formed after
            the image of his Maker, endowed with a portion of intellectual
            divinity, the governor and subjugator of all other beings, is, by
            his wisdom alone, able to form just conclusions from such things as
            present themselves to his senses, which can only consist of bodies
            merely natural. Hence the first step of wisdom is to know these
            bodies; and to be able, by those marks imprinted on them by nature,
            to distinguish them from each other, and to affix to every object
            its proper name.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are the elements of all sciences; this is the great alphabet
            of nature: for if the name be lost, the knowledge of the object is
            lost also; and without these, the student will seek in vain for the
            means to investigate the hidden treasures of nature.

His system for naming, ranking, and classifying organisms is still in wide use today (with many changes). His ideas on classification have influenced generations of biologists during and after his own lifetime, even those opposed to the philosophical and theological roots of his work.<br><br><hr><h3>Biography of Linnaeus</h3>He was born on May 23, 1707, at Stenbrohult, in the province of Småland in southern Sweden. His father, Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus, was both an avid gardener and a Lutheran pastor, and Carl showed a deep love of plants and a fascination with their names from a very early age. Carl disappointed his parents by showing neither aptitude nor desire for the priesthood, but his family was somewhat consoled when Linnaeus entered the University of Lund in 1727 to study medicine. A year later, he transferred to the University of Uppsala, the most prestigious university in Sweden. However, its medical facilities had been neglected and had fallen into disrepair. Most of Linnaeus’s time at Uppsala was spent collecting and studying plants, his true love. At the time, training in botany was part of the medical curriculum, for every doctor had to prepare and prescribe drugs derived from medicinal plants. Despite being in hard financial straits, Linnaeus mounted a botanical and ethnographical expedition to Lapland in 1731 (the portrait above shows Linnaeus as a young man, wearing a version of the traditional Lapp costume and holding a shaman’s drum). In 1734 he mounted another expedition to central Sweden.<br><br>Linnaeus went to the Netherlands in 1735, promptly finished his medical degree at the University of Harderwijk, and then enrolled in the University of Leiden for further studies. That same year, he published the first edition of his classification of living things, the <i>Systema Naturae</i>. During these years, he met or corresponded with Europe’s great botanists, and continued to develop his classification scheme. Returning to Sweden in 1738, he practiced medicine (specializing in the treatment of syphilis) and lectured in Stockholm before  being awarded a professorship at Uppsala in 1741. At Uppsala, he restored the  University’s botanical garden (arranging the plants according to his system of classification), made three more expeditions to various parts of Sweden, and inspired a generation of students. He was instrumental in arranging to have his students sent out on trade and exploration voyages to all parts of the world: nineteen of Linnaeus’s students went out on these voyages of discovery. Perhaps his most famous student, Daniel Solander, was the naturalist on Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world voyage, and brought back the first plant collections from Australia and the South Pacific to Europe. Anders Sparrman, another of Linnaeus’s students, was a botanist on Cook’s second voyage. Another student, Pehr Kalm, traveled in the northeastern American colonies for three years studying American plants. Yet another, Carl Peter Thunberg, was the first Western naturalist to visit Japan in over a century; he not only studied the flora of Japan, but taught Western medicine to Japanese practicioners. Still others of his students traveled to South America, southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many died on their travels.<br><br>Linnaeus continued to revise his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, which grew from a slim pamphlet to a multivolume work, as his concepts were modified and as more and more plant and animal specimens were sent to him from every corner of the globe. At the time he referred to humanity as <i>Homo diurnis</i>, or “man of the day.” Linnaeus was also deeply involved with ways to make the Swedish economy more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign trade, either by acclimatizing valuable plants to grow in Sweden, or by finding native substitutes. Unfortunately, Linnaeus’s attempts to grow cacao, coffee, tea, bananas, rice, and mulberries proved unsuccessful in Sweden’s cold climate. His attempts to boost the economy (and to prevent the famines that still struck Sweden at the time) by finding native Swedish plants that could be used as tea, coffee, flour, and fodder were also not generally successful. He still found time to practice medicine, eventually becoming personal physician to the Swedish royal family. In 1758 he bought  the manor estate of Hammarby, outside Uppsala, where he built a small museum for his extensive personal collections. In 1761 he was granted nobility, and became Carl von Linné. His later years were marked by increasing depression and pessimism. Lingering on for several years after suffering what was probably a series of mild strokes in 1774, he died in 1778.  His son, also named Carl, succeeded to his professorship at Uppsala, but never was noteworthy as a botanist. When Carl the Younger died five years later with no heirs, his mother and sisters sold the elder Linnaeus’s library, manuscripts, and natural history collections to the English natural historian Sir James Edward Smith, who founded the Linnean Society of London to take care of them.<br><br><b>Source:</b> From the website of the <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html" target="_blank">University of California Museum of Paleontology</a>

          What are the unalienable rights of man (Articles 1-17)? What is the
          purpose of establishing these rights to the people and how does it
          affect the relationship between those who govern and those who are
          governed (paragraph 1)? What is revolutionary about this text is that
          it establishes a precedent of governance whereby people have certain
          rights afforded to them, so that the government cannot rule with
          wanton abandon. It reflects the Enlightenment ideals of social
          critique; how society needs to curtail the power of political
          authority in pursuance of intellectual liberty. Individuals should
          only obey a political authority if that authority respects the
          “rights” of the people (Articles 14-15).
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[11]">
          The rights of man is written in the format of a list, which outlines
          the “natural, inalienable and sacred rights of man” (p1, ⁋1) First the
          document explains that they will list the rights of man as
          representatives of the French People as well as the rights and duties
          of the leaders. Throughout the text there is the repetition of words
          such as “all”, “same”, “every”, and “equal”. This repetition
          emphasizes their idea that “All citizens, being equal in the eyes of
          the law, are equally eligible to all dignities…” (p2, ⁋7) The text is
          written in a tone which is very authoritative in the sense that it
          presents these rights as a given. In the very title of “Declaration if
          the Rights of Man” the word declaration forms this idea since a
          declaration is an announcement and announcements are generally not up
          for debate, but already established. Adding to this tone the text also
          does not seem to give much explanation as to why these are all rights.
          It uses phrases such as “happiness of all” (pg2, ⁋1), and “general
          good” (p2, ⁋2) to explain the goal of these right but are very vague.
          This text reflects Enlightenment ideas in how it tries to create
          universal guidelines, which is an example of how people during this
          time were searching for universal ideas. It is also connected since it
          was written with the idea of accomplishing one of the main goals of
          this movement which is “happiness”. It can be seen as revolutionary in
          the sense that the French came together and their representatives
          (National Assembly) were taking action and declaring what they deserve
          and expect from their nation. These people were no longer simply
          obeying what they were told, but rather using their own reasoning and
          understanding to create the list of their rights.
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[12]">
          Olympe de Gouges’ “Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female
          Citizen” is a document written in direct response to the “Declaration
          of the Rights of Man” written by the French National Assembly two
          years prior. Keeping this in mind, the context of the document becomes
          abundantly clear. The revolution in France is in full swing and as
          representatives of the people, men declared their inalienable rights
          and separated themselves from the monarchy. This does not sit with de
          Gouge because the written articles only mention men. As a result she
          rewrites many of the original articles replacing ‘man’ with ‘women’
          while perpetuating and asserting the idea that men and women are
          equal. For example, Article 17 of the “Declaration of Rights of Man”
          states, “Since property is an inviolable and sacred right, no one
          shall be deprived thereof except where public necessity, legally
          determined, shall clearly demand it, and then only on condition that
          the owner shall have been previously and equitably indemnified.”
          Meanwhile the first article of the “Declaration of Rights of Woman”
          states, “Property belongs to both sexes whether united or separate;
          for each it is an inviolable and sacred right; no one can be deprived
          of it, since it is the true patrimony of nature, unless the legally
          determined public need obviously dictates it, and then only with a
          just and prior indemnity”(4). In writing her declaration, de Gouge
          asserts that women can and should participate in the enlightening
          aspect of the French Revolution. What is so revolutionary about this
          is that de Gouge is a woman championing women’s rights in time where
          this was unheard of. Women had not been able to break into specific
          social, political, and cultural spheres in this time period.
          Additionally, women during the American Revolution were also able to
          attain similar rights that the men declared they had.
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[13]">
          The most significant part that is missing from the “Declaration of the
          Rights of Man” is addressing the people of different race, ethnicity,
          and skin color. The passage seems to be stating all the rights of men,
          and it never talks about different ethnicities and skin colors. Even
          though we are in the enlightenment period and we can see the
          significant changes (such as new knowledge and more people knowing how
          to exercise their rights), white men and men of color are still not
          same. During 1789, there were still slaves. Slaves did not have the
          same rights and freedom as stated in the declaration; the colored
          slaves were below the white men. Therefore, the passage should add an
          Article clarifying whom the declaration includes. For example, when
          the passage states “men are born and remain free and equal in
          rights”[1] This probably does not include the slaves, knowing that
          slaves were still mistreated in 1789. If this is the case, the text
          should add somewhere in the text the types of people the declaration
          is including, so it doesn’t cause misunderstandings. In the end, as
          shown from the “Declaration of the Rights of Men,” the ideas and
          amount of knowledge the ordinary people know are flourishing. In the
          past, the public relied on the elites to tell their rights, but now it
          has changed (enlightenment period) Although it has changed, they are
          still far away from where we are today. [1] “Declaration of the Rights
          of Men” (August 26, 1789)
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[14]">
          In the Declaration of the Rights of Man, with a focus on page one of
          the document, there are many surprising elements. The first is that
          the text is proclaiming rights solely for men, excluding women from
          this document’s benefits. While this element is more tragic than
          anything as it is a representation of extreme gender inequality in
          these ancient times, it is still a surprising aspect. Another shocking
          element is how there is specification that these rights are given to
          men who are citizens and not just men as a whole. This leads ones
          identity and worth in society during this time to be tied to their
          citizenship as well as their gender. Furthermore, the text makes the
          claim that “No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions,
          including his religious views” (Declaration of the Rights of Man).
          This is peculiar as it is quite a jump from the approach of many
          ancient empires and dynasties we have studied. In previous times, it
          was not uncommon to use forced conversion and take a proselytizing
          approach to the concept of religion within a state; this completely
          overrules that approach. Lastly, another line in the text states,
          “Many rights involve obedience to societal norms, yet document
          introduction is directed towards exclusively men with citizenship”
          (Declaration of the Rights of Man). I found this to be particularly
          interesting because in a document where in addition to proclamation of
          rights there are calls to legal and social order, one would logically
          assume that this applies to all members of society, but with the
          text’s exclusive nature that does not appear to be the case. One
          strong aspect I found to be revolutionary in this piece was that the
          document’s creation is rooted in representatives that were organized
          on the basis of “believing that the ignorance, neglect or contempt of
          the rights of man are the sole cause of public calamities
          and…corruption of governments” (Declaration of the Rights of Man).
          This is a revolutionary and important way of beginning a long-lasting
          manner of criticizing governmental flaws. The revolutionary nature of
          the text is furthered in its lack of explicit racial distinctions.
          Racial specifications in texts during this time were not uncommon, as
          seen in Kant’s “On the Different Races of Man” written only fourteen
          years prior to the Declaration of the Rights of Man, yet this text
          contains none. Though there is definitely language used to separate
          people based on gender and citizenship, it is worth noting that the
          use of “men” when referencing who would receive these rights without
          specifying the race of said men is quite revolutionary. Lastly, the
          document presents a balance between recognizing all-powerful position
          of law, government representatives, and the state as a whole over its
          people while guaranteeing this power will not be abused trough
          specification and appropriate allocation of rights to people. This is
          revolutionary especially in comparison to the dynasties and empires we
          have previously studied, where there were such stark contrasts in
          power dynamics between rulers and common-people.

      <div class="footnote" id="[15]">
          In this passage, what is surprising is that the way Linne describes the different perceived races of humans is somewhat biased. It can be seen in the words and verbiage that he uses that he is of the European group and is much more favorable of them as he describes their features as “fair”, “brawny”, with “flowing” hair, and that they are “Governed by laws” (1). However, for other races such as the Native Americans, he describes them as having “harsh” faces, while the Asians have “covetous”, or greedy, eyes, and Africans have “indolent”, or lazy, lips. Thus, it is surprising that Linne seems to be implying behavioral characteristics through the description of physical ones, thus relating behavior to race and implying a superiority in the European race.

          “A ‘system of elements’ – a definition of the segments by which the resemblances and differences can be shown, the types of variation by which those segments can be affected, and, lastly, the threshold above which there is a difference and below which there is a similitude – is indispensable for the establishment of even the simplest form of order.” (xx)<br><br>“It is this configuration that, from the nineteenth century onward, changes entirely; the theory of representation disappears as the universal foundation of all possible orders; language as the spontaneous tabula, the primary grid of things, as an indispensable link between representation and things, is eclipsed in its turn; a profound historicity penetrates into the heart of things, isolates and defines them in their own coherence, imposes upon them the forms of order implied by the continuity of time; the analysis of exchange and money gives way to the study of production, that of the organism takes precedence over the search for taxonomic characteristics, and, above all, language loses its privileged position and becomes, in its turn, a historical form coherent with the density of its own past.” (xxiii)<br><br>“By limiting and filtering the visible, structure enables it to be transcribed into language. It permits the visibility of the animal or plant to pass over in its entirety into the discourse that receives it. And ultimately, perhaps, it may manage to reconstitute itself in visible form by means of words, as with the botanical calligrams dreamed of by Linnaeus. His wish was that the order of the description, its division into paragraphs, and even its typographical modules, should reproduce the form of the plant itself. That the printed text, in its variables of form, arrangement, and quantity, should have a vegetable structure” (135)

          “European travel literature was obsessed with skin color differences.  Associations of light with good and darkness with evil were common in classical and early Christian culture and tended to dominate perceptions of other peoples with different skin pigmentation.  In the absence of personal experience to counter these associations, they were passed from one generation to the next and became endemic stereotypes.” (122)<br><br>“Linnaeus’s descriptions of humans and humanlike creatures were distilled from various written accounts and were concerned more with problems of nomenclature than with comparative anatomy or direct observation.  His system of classification was revolutionary in that it included humans with other parts of the natural world, but it was old-fashioned in its mixing of old myths with new science, ancient traditions, and contemporary evidence.” (127)

          “The foundation of botany is two-fold, arrangement and nomenclature… Arrangement is the foundation of nomenclature.  Knowledge of botany bears on these hinges, thus all plants become known in a single year, at first sight, with no instructor and without pictures or descriptions, by means of stable recollection. Therefore, anyone who knows this is a botanist, and no one else is.” (111)

          “In short, it is our opinion that taxonomies and terms should be designed to fit the facts, and not the facts forced into the procrustean rack of pre-determined categories. If we are to have references, whether terminological or taxonomical, to existing or extinct populations of man, let the conditions as we find them determine the character of our terms or taxonomies, and not the other way round.”

          “The simile proposed by Linnaeus for the arrangement of butterflies, is gleaned from ancient and fabulous history.  The species are divided into sections of Trojan and Greek princes, heroes, deities, nymphs and plebeians: this allegorical system, which is well conducted, seems liable to less objection, than the characters assigned to each section.” (52)
