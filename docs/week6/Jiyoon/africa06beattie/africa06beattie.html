            <h3>James Beattie, “A Response to Hume” (1770), <i>General and Particular</i>
            (multivolume work published between 1748-1808); from Emmanuel
            Chukwudi Eze, ed., <i>Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader</i> (Malden, MA:
            Blackwell, 2007), 36-37.</h3>
          </p>
          … they have none, because they have no letters, but in oratory, some
          of them, particularly the Indians of the Five Nations, are said to be
          greatly our superiors. It will be readily allowed that the condition
          of a slave is not favourable to genius of any kind; and yet, the
          negro-slaves dispersed over <a>Europe</a>, have often discovered symptoms of
          ingenuity, notwithstanding their unhappy circumstances. They become
          excellent handicraftsmen, and practical musicians, and indeed learn
          everything their masters are at pains to teach them, perfidy and
          debauchery not excepted. That a negro-slave, who can neither read nor
          write, nor speak any European language, who is not permitted to do
          anything but what his master commands, and who has not a friend on
          earth, but is universally considered and treated as if he were of a
          species inferior to the human - that such a creature should so
          distinguish himself among Europeans, as to be talked of throughout the
          world for a man of genius, i<a>s surely no reasonable expectation</a>. To
          suppose him of an inferior species, because he does not thus
          distinguish himself, is just as rational as to suppose any private
          European of an inferior species, because he has not raised himself to
          the condition of royalty. Had the Europeans been <a>destitute of the arts</a>
          of writing and working in iron, they might have remained to this day
          <a>as barbarous as the natives of Africa and America</a>. Nor is the
          invention of these arts to be ascribed to our superior capacity. The
          genius of the inventor is not always to be estimated according to the
          <a>importance of the invention</a>. Gunpowder and the mariner's compass have
          produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs, and yet were
          accidental discoveries. Such, probably, were the first essays in
          writing and working with iron. Suppose them the effects of
          contrivance: they were at least contrived by a few individuals, and if
          they required a superiority of understanding, or of species, in the
          inventors, those inventors, and their descendants, are the only people
          who can lay claim to the <a>honour</a> of that superiority.


          <p>
            That every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not
            according to the usages of modern Europe, seems to be a fundamental
            maxim with many of our critics and philosophers. Their remarks often
            put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion. If Negroes and
            Indians were disposed to recriminate; if a
            <a>Lucian or a Voltaire from the coast of Guinea</a>, or from the
            Five Nations, were to pay us a visit, what a picture of European
            manners he would present to his countrymen at his return! Nor would
            caricature, or exaggeration be necessary to render it hideous. A
            plain historical account of some of our most fashionable duellists,
            gamblers, and adulterers (to name no more) would exhibit specimens
            of <a>brute barbarity</a>, and sottish infatuation such as might vie
            with any that ever appeared in Kamschatka, California, or the land
            of the Hottentots.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to see with what views some modern authors throw out
            these hints to prove the natural inferiority of the Negroes. But let
            every <a>friend of humanity</a> pray, that they may be disappointed.
            <a>Britons are famous for generosity</a>, a virtue in which it is
            easy for them to excel both the Romans and Greeks. Let it never be
            said, that slavery is countenanced by the bravest, and most generous
            people on earth; by a people who are animated with that heroic
            passion, the love of liberty, beyond all nations ancient or modern;
            and the fame of whose toilsome, but unwearied perseverance, in
            vindicating, at the expense of life and fortune,
            <a
              >the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror into the hearts
              of sycophants and tyrants</a
            >, and excite the admiration and gratitude of all good men to the
            latest posterity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Editor's note: It seems that Hume responded to some of Beattie's
            criticisms by making some alterations to the text of "Of National
            Characters," in a
            <a
              href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709889?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents"
              >1776 revision</a
            >
            of his work, which was published posthumously in 1777. Below, a
            short passage from the 1754 text is followed by the corresponding
            passage from the 1776 one.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other species
              of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be
              naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized
              nation of any other complexion than white . . .
            </p>

            <p>
              I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the
              whites. <a>There scarcely ever</a> was a civilized nation of that
              complexion, nor even of individual eminent in action or
              speculation…
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>All else in the essay remained unchanged.</p>

          <b>(AUTH)</b> (AUTH) The way the author writes about the slaves and the words that are used make it clear that he sees the slaves as inferior, even though he may show a little bit of sympathy
        </div>
        <div class="footnotes" id="destitute of the arts">
        <b>(AUTH)</b> It seems that the author deems arts and literature as an inherently European thing and that African slaves were granted exposure to the arts upon leaving their homeland. One can realize that this assumption is erroneous upon examining African oral history and lore.

        <b>(M)(Q)</b> How would you find such a person? The author tries to
        paint Africans and Europeans as equal, but he is only able to do so by
        imagining there are Africans like Europeans. The Europeans are still
        the only standard.

        <div class="footnotes" id="brute barbarity">
        <b>(SU)</b> Beattie, unlike other philosophers, acknowledges the
        barbaric treatment and depictions of Africans and refutes these
        depictions
        </div>
        <div class="footnotes" id="friend of humanity">
        <b>(ST)</b> The description of 'friend of humanity' suggests that
        those who do not agree with the author's views are not a friend of
        humanity. thus, a. humanity would include both black people and white
        people b. people who oppose this are cruel, et
        </div>
        <div class="footnotes" id="Britons are famous for generosity">
        <b>(ST)(AUD)</b> This response may have also been a work of moral
        appeal to discourage Britons from supporting slavery.

        id="the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror into the hearts of sycophants and tyrants"

        <b>(ST)(A)</b> Although this piece was in response to Hume, Beattie
        uses comparisons and intense diction to counterfeit Hume's claim.
        </div>
        <div class="footnotes" id="There scarcely ever">
        <b>(SU)</b> It is surprising that Hume adjusted his view, maybe as the
        commonly accepted view of racial inferiority wasn't as widely accepted
        between scholars as it was a few decades later.
