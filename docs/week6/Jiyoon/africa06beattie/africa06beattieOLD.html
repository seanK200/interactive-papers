              <a data-ip-footnote-id="10">[...]</a> they have none, because they have no letters, but in oratory, some of
              them, particularly the Indians of the Five Nations, are said to be greatly
              our superiors. It will be readily allowed that the condition of a slave is not
              favourable to genius of any kind; and yet, the negro-slaves dispersed over
              Europe, have often discovered symptoms of ingenuity, notwithstanding
              their unhappy circumstances. They become excellent handicraftsmen, and
              practical musicians, and indeed learn everything their masters are at pains to
              teach them, perfidy and debauchery not excepted. That a negro-slave, who
              can neither read nor write, nor speak any European language, who is not
              permitted to do anything but what his master commands, and who has not a
              friend on earth, but is universally considered and treated as if he were of a
              species inferior to the human - that such a creature should so
              distinguish himself among Europeans, as to be talked of throughout the world
              for a man of genius, is surely no reasonable expectation. To suppose him of
              an inferior species, because he does not thus distinguish himself, is just as
              rational as to suppose any private European of an inferior species, because he
              has not raised himself to the condition of royalty.<br>
              <br>
              Had the Europeans been destitute of the arts of writing and working in iron,
              they might have remained to this day as barbarous as the natives of Africa
              and America. Nor is the invention of these arts to be ascribed to our superior
              capacity. The genius of the inventor is not always to be estimated according
              to the importance of the invention. Gunpowder and the mariner's compass
              have produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs, and yet were
              accidental discoveries. Such, probably, were the first essays in writing and
              working with iron. Suppose them the effects of contrivance: they were at
              least contrived by a few individuals, and if they required a superiority of
              understanding, or of species, in the inventors, those inventors, and their
              descendants, are the only people who can lay claim to the honour of that
              superiority.<br>
              <br>
              That every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not according to the
              usages of modern Europe, seems to be a fundamental maxim with many of
              our critics and philosophers. Their remarks often put us in mind of the fable
              of the man and the lion. If Negroes and Indians were disposed to recriminate;
              if a Lucian or a Voltaire from the coast of Guinea, or from the Five Nations,
              were to pay us a visit, what a picture of European manners he would
              present to his countrymen at his return! Nor would caricature, or
              exaggeration be necessary to render it hideous. A plain historical account of
              some of our most fashionable duellists, gamblers, and adulterers (to name no
              more) would exhibit specimens of brute barbarity, and sottish
              infatuation such as might vie with any that ever appeared in
              Kamschatka, California, or the land of the Hottentots.<br>
              <br>
              It is easy to see with what views some modern authors throw out these hints
              to prove the natural inferiority of the Negroes. But let every friend of
              humanity pray, that they may be disappointed. Britons are famous for
              generosity, a virtue in which it is easy for them to excel both the Romans and
              Greeks. Let it never be said, that slavery is countenanced by the bravest, and
              most generous people on earth; by a people who are animated with that
              heroic passion, the love of liberty, beyond all nations ancient or modern; and the fame of whose toilsome, but unwearied perseverance, in vindicating, at
              the expense of life and fortune, the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror
              into the hearts of sycophants and tyrants, and excite the admiration and
              gratitude of all good men to the latest posterity.<br>
              <br>

              <i>Editor's note</i>: It seems that Hume responded to some of Beattie's criticisms
              by making some alterations to the text of "Of National Characters," in a 1776
              revision of his work, which was published posthumously in 1777. Below, a
              short passage from the 1754 text is followed by the corresponding passage
              from the 1776 one.
              <blockquote>I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other species of men (for
              there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites.
              There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white . . .
              I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites. There
              scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion, nor even of
              individual eminent in action or speculation…</blockquote>
              All else in the essay remained unchanged.

His best known philosophical work, <i>An Essay on The Nature and Immutability of Truth In Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism</i> (1770), is a rhetorical tour de force which affirmed the sovereignty of common sense while attacking David Hume (1711-1776). A smash bestseller in its day, this <i>Essay on Truth</i> made Beattie very famous and Hume very angry. The work’s fame proved fleeting, as did Beattie’s philosophical reputation.<br><br>Douglas McDermid, Trent University, Canada </div>

First, it is an important document in the history of the Scottish common sense school of philosophy inaugurated by Beattie’s colleague, Thomas Reid (1710-1796). Second, Beattie’s style--lively, polished, pure, and lucid--still has the power to please and charm. Finally, Beattie is an abler philosopher than his vociferous detractors were willing to allow. Though by no means an original or profound thinker, he can and should be given credit for presenting a systematic and accessible defense of a simple-sounding thesis--that philosophy cannot afford to despise the plain dictates of common sense.<br><br>Douglas McDermid, Trent University, Canada </div>
      <div class="footnote" id="5"> Although the <i>Essay on Truth</i> is largely devoted to re-instating the rights of common sense in the spheres of epistemology and metaphysics, it includes a forceful critique of Hume’s racism.<br><br><i>Hume’s racism</i>? To some, this phrase may have a strange and novel sound. After all, Hume is usually portrayed as a patron saint of the Enlightenment: a genial cosmopolitan, sweetly reasonable, unfailingly courteous and amiable, “as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit” (in the oft-cited words of his friend, Adam Smith). Yet in Hume’s essay “Of National Characters,” we catch a glimpse of a different side of <i>le bon David</i>. For there, in an infamous footnote, Hume writes:<blockquote>I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites. There scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion, nor any individual, eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences ... [T]here are Negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity.</blockquote>In the <i>Essay on Truth</i>, Beattie condemns these sentiments: “These assertions are strong; but I know not whether they have anything else to recommend them.” (III. ii). Beattie does not stop there. Beattie does not merely fulminate against Hume’s racism with a self-serving show of conspicuous indignation; instead he rolls up his sleeves and adroitly dissects Hume’s pro-racist arguments. <b>(1)</b> Beattie disputes Hume’s basic assertions about the achievements (or alleged lack thereof) of non-European societies: “[W]e know that these assertions are not true ... The Africans and Americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them, which even Europeans would find it no easy matter to imitate.” (III. ii). <b>(2)</b> Moreover, Beattie says, Hume’s reasoning is invalid. For even if Hume’s claims were correct, his conclusion would not follow. “[O]ne may as well say of an infant, that he can never become a man, as of a nation now barbarous, that it never can be civilized.” (III. Ii). Should anyone doubt this, he need only recall that “[t]hat the inhabitants of Great Britain and France were as savage two thousand years ago, as those of Africa and America are at this day.” (III. ii). <b>(3)</b> Beattie is unimpressed by Hume’s argument that “there are Negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity.” Beattie insists that this claim is unwarranted as well as false. But even if it were true, it would not justify belief in Hume’s natural inferiority thesis, for “the condition of a slave is not favourable to genius of any kind.” (III. ii). <b>(4)</b> While Beattie does not downgrade European achievements in the arts and sciences, he denies that they can be used to prove that European nations or “races” are superior. He stresses the extent that the achievements on which European nations pride themselves were either discovered by accident or the inventions of a gifted few, to whom alone all credit must go.<br><br>Beattie caps his rebuttal with two observations. First, his critique of Hume’s natural inferiority thesis indirectly supports the cause of religion because such racism cannot be reconciled neatly with a true Judeo-Christian understanding of human nature. Second, Beattie stresses that his disagreement with Hume on the subject of racism is not merely theoretical or speculative. On the contrary, the dispute is intensely practical, for the natural inferiority thesis can (and frequently was) invoked to justify slavery - an institution that Beattie, a committed abolitionist, decried as “a barbarous piece of policy.” </div>
		  <div class="footnote" id="10"> Mr HUME argues nearly in the same manner in regard to the superiority of white men over black. "I am apt to suspect," says he, "the negroes, and in general, all the other species of men, (for there are four or five different kinds), to be naturally inferior to the whites. There <i>never</i> was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, <i>nor even any individual</i> eminent either in action of speculation. <i>No</i> ingenious manufacturers among them, <i>no</i> arts, no sciences.--There are negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of which <i>none</i> ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity." These assertions are strong; but I know not whether they have any thing else to recommend them.--For, first, tho’ true, they would not prove the point in question, except it were also proved, that the Africans and Americans, even though arts and sciences were introduced among them, would still remain unsusceptible of cultivation. The inhabitants of Great Britain and France were as savage two thousand years ago, as those of Africa and America are at this day. To civilize a nation is a work which requires long time to accomplish. And one say of an infant, that he can never become a man, as of a nation, now barbarous, that it can never be civilized.--Secondly, of the facts here asserted, no man could have sufficient evidence, except from a personal acquaintance with all the negroes that now are, or ever were, on the face of the earth. These people write no histories; and all the travellers that ever visited them, will not amount to any thing like a proof of what is here affirmed. But, thirdly, we know that these assertions are not true. The empires of Peru and Mexico could not have been governed, nor the metropolis of the latter built after so singular a manner, in the middle of a lake, without men eminent, both for action and speculation. Every body has heard of the magnificence, good government, and ingenuity of the ancient Peruvians. The Africans and Americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them, which even Europeans would find it no easy matter to imitate. Sciences indeed </div>
