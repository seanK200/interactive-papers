          … are fitted to live in all climates, such as dogs, horses, etc. do not
          attain the same perfection in all. The courage of bull-dogs and gamecocks
          seems peculiar to England. Flanders is remarkable for large and
          heavy horses, Spain for horses light, and of good mettle. Any breed of
          these creatures, transplanted from one country to another, will soon lose
          the qualities, which they derived from their native climate. It may be
          asked, why not the same with men?<br>
          <br>
          There are few questions more curious than this, or which will more often
          occur in our inquiries concerning human affairs; and therefore it may be
          proper to give it a full examination.<br>
          <br>
          The human mind is of a very imitative nature; nor <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n241" target="_blank">[230-231]</a> is it possible for any set
          of men to converse often together, without acquiring a similitude of
          manners and communicating to each other their vices as well as virtues.
          The propensity to company and society is strong in all rational creatures; and
          the same disposition, which gives us this propensity, makes us enter deeply
          into each other’s sentiments, and causes like passions and inclinations to
          run, as it were, by contagion, through that whole club or knot of
          companions. Where a number of men are united into one political body the
          occasions of their intercourse must be so frequent, for defense, commerce
          and government, that, together with the same speech or language, they must
          acquire a resemblance in their manners, and have a common or national
          character, as well as a personal one, peculiar to each individual. Now
          though nature produces all kinds of temper and understanding in
          great abundance, it does not follow, that she always produces them in like
          proportions and that in every society the ingredients of industry and
          indolence, valour and cowardice, humanity and brutality, wisdom and folly,
          will be mixed after the same manner. In the infancy of society, if any of these
          dispositions be found in greater abundance than the rest, it will
          naturally prevail in the compositions and give a tincture to the
          national character ... <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n243" target="_blank">[232-233]</a><br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n245" target="_blank">[234-235]</a> If the characters of men depended on the air and climate, the degrees of heat
          and cold should naturally be expected to have a mighty influence; since
          nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational animals. And indeed
          there is some reason to think, that all the nations, which live beyond the polar
          circles or between the tropics, are inferior to the rest of the species, and are
          incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind. The poverty and
          misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and the indolence of the
          southern from their few necessities, may, perhaps, account for this
          remarkable difference, without our having recourse to physical causes. This
          however is certain, that the <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n247" target="_blank">[236-237]</a> characters of nations are very promiscuous in the
          temperate climates, and that almost all the general observations, which have
          been formed of the more southern or more northern people in these climates,
          are found to be uncertain and fallacious. <blockquote>[In a footnote:] I am apt to suspect
          the negroes and in general all other species of men (for there are four or five
          different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a
          civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any
          individual eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures
          amongst them, no arts, no sciences. On the other hand, the most rude and
          barbarous of the whites, such as the ancient Germans, the present Tartars,
          have still something eminent about them, in their valour, form of
          government, or some other particular. Such a uniform and constant difference
          could not happen, in so many countries and ages if nature had not made an
          original distinction between these breeds of men. Not to mention our
          colonies, there are negroe slaves dispersed all over Europe, of whom none
          ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity; though low people without
          education will start up amongst us and distinguish themselves in every
          profession. In Jamaica, indeed, they talk of one negroe as a man of parts
          and learning; but it is likely he is admired for slender accomplishments, like a
          parrot who speaks a few words plainly [end of footnote]</blockquote> . . . <br>
          <br>
          Lord BACON has observed, that the inhabitants of the south are, in general,
          more ingenious than those of the north; but that, where the native of a cold
          climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the
          southern wits. This observation a later writer confirms, by comparing
          the southern wits to cucumbers, which are commonly all good in their kind;
          but at best are an insipid fruit; while the northern geniuses are like melons, of
          which not one in fifty is good; but when it is so, it has an exquisite relish. I
          believe this remark may be allowed just, when confined to the
          European nations . . . <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n249" target="_blank">[238-239]</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n251" target="_blank">[240-241]</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n253" target="_blank">[242-243]</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwo14humegoog/page/n255" target="_blank">[237]</a><br><br>

Hume’s empiricist approach to philosophy places him with John Locke, George Berkeley, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes as a British Empiricist. Beginning with his <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> (1739–40), Hume strove to create a total naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Against philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of innate ideas, positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in experience.<br><br>In what is sometimes referred to as Hume’s problem of induction, he argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of "constant conjunction" of events. This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined. Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.<br><br>Hume’s opposition to the teleological argument for God’s existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to Darwinism.<br><br>Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". Hume’s moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the virtue ethics tradition of ancient philosophy, with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than acts or their consequences, as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation. Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done. Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume’s compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom.<br><br>Hume influenced utilitarianism, logical positivism, Immanuel Kant, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers". </div>

What does "philosophical" racism mean? Assuming that philosophical racism is something which we wish to take notice of, what part of Hume’s philosophy sustains it? How much of Hume’s philosophy may be affected by this, and how profound?<br><br>On the surface it seems not to make sense to ask, for example, how profound Hume’s "philosophical racism" is or how deeply racist his philosophical works may be. The question appears contrived because, currently, every reference in the literature seem to point to only a footnote: <blockquote>I am apt to suspect the Negroes and in general all other species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites.

It was also revised in the final edition of the <i>Essays: Moral, Political and Literary</i>, which Hume had prepared shortly before he died in 1777. <b>[3]</b> Meanwhile, the original version of "Of National Characters" was written in 1748.<br><br>An equally reasonable point of view on the matter, however, is to show that, far from being philosophically unimportant or an after-thought, the footnote, both its addition several years after the original essay was written and its maintenance in the subsequent revisions by Hume, suggests that the ideas expressed therein were important to the author and, significantly, to the arguments of "Of National Characters." It is known that by 1770 James Beattie, in <i>An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, in Opposition to Sophistry and Skepticism</i>, had extensively criticized "Of National Character," specifically the note under consideration. Hume was aware of this and other criticisms and responded or commented on them in letters to friends, among other places. In a letter to his friend and publisher, William Straham, later published in <i>London Chronicle</i> (12-14 June 1777), Hume discussed dismissively criticisms from Thomas Reid and James Beattie, referring to the latter as "a bigoted silly fellow." <b>[4]</b> The fact that it survived Hume’s multiple revisions and remained part of the <i>Essays</i> and was publicly defended from criticisms invites one not to dismiss this lengthy addition as marginal to Hume’s thought but rather to determine why he might have felt it needed to be added in the first place, revised, and critically defended in what is now its definitive version. Relevant specific questions would be: why, of all other possible places (I have in mind, for example, a comparable essay "Of the populousness of ancient nations"), was the footnote added here? How does the opinion in this note relate to the main arguments of "Of National Characters"? Do the contents of this essay, especially in their implicit and explicit philosophical commitments, have a relationship to Hume’s most important works, such as the <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>?<br><br><hr><br> 2 David Hume, <i>The Philosophical Works</i>, ed. T. H. Green and T. H. Grose (London, III, 253.<br><br>3 Further references are to the revised edition, which contains the following modifications to the original (quoted above): "I am apt to suspect the Negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites. There scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion, nor even individual eminent in action or speculation...." The rest remained unchanged. It is very probable that the modification was prompted by James Beattie’s criticisms. Relevant excerpts of this critique, and further discussion of the historical contexts of Hume’s "racism" may be found in E. C. Eze (ed.), <i>Race and the Enlightenment</i> (Oxford, 1997).<br><br>4 See Letter of David Hume, II, 1766-76, ed. J. Y. T. Greig (Oxford, 1932), 299-302.<br><br><center>692</center></div>
          <div class="footnote" id="13">My purpose is to show that, far from being marginal to his body of philosophical work, Hume’s "remark" about the races, the Negro in particular, is grounded in Hume’s theory of human nature or, as he often called it, "science of man." When Hume says, for example, that Negroes have "no arts, no sciences," he is drawing conclusions from his highly sophisticated theory of mind, a theory within and from which it can be shown that he believed that the Negro does not possess specific mental abilities needed to produce science and culture.<br><br><center>Hume’s Negro Mind</center><br> As is well known, for Hume "the mind" is not a thing or an object existing independent of perception: perception is "the mind." To perceive is to feel and to have ideas and, from them, to think and to judge, etc. Hume succinctly states: "what we call a mind, is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations." <b>[5]</b><br><br>We must draw attention to this idea that there are "certain relations" which keep perception "united together" as a "heap or collection." This notion of "certain relations," capable of imposing relative unity upon perception, is important because it is in and through the organizing activity that a person can claim to be more or less a "unity," a "self," and therefore "human." It is also on the relative and varying degrees of "certainty" provided or guaranteed by these "relations" that Hume would find, or locate, varying degrees of certainty for knowledge in the arts and the sciences. Finally, the "certain relations" at the highest theoretical anthropological and epistemological levels underwrite the distinction "in kind" that Hume established in the <i>Essays</i> between the "white" race and the "non-white" races. Simply put if the Negro race is inherently and by "nature" incapable of "arts and sciences," it is because nature had not endowed this race with the "certain relations" of the mind on the basis of which culture, science, and the arts are possible. The Negro "species of men," understandably, would also be ontologically "inferior" to other humans because for Hume these are also the "certain relations" that make possible the relative unity of self in which we cultivate forces against dispersion, psychological and metaphysical.<br><br>The fact that Hume believed the supposedly inferior psychological and cognitive state of the Negro to be on the one hand permanent and on the other racially based and therefore individually or collectively unremediable can be deduced from the following: while "the most rude and barbarous of the whites ... have still something eminent about them, in their valor, form of government, or some other particular," he explains that "there are NEGRO slaves dispersed all over EUROPE, of which none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity; tho’ low [white] people, without education, will start up amongst us, and distinguish<br><br><hr><br>5 David Hume, <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>, ed.

          <div class="footnote" id="14">themselves in every profession." Hume therefore concluded, "Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men."<br><br>To grasp the philosophical significance and (racialized) depth of this view of the Negro and human nature, one could approach Hume’s theory of the mind from another perspective-the perspective of the distinction he draws between "passive" and "active" (functions of) reasoning. This perspective enables one to see just how complex is Hume’s theory of perception and how deeply encoded in this theory is the racial idea. Since it is on the basis of the assumption that there exist seven kinds (one wonders, why not five, eight, or twenty?) of "philosophical relations" that Hume codified the mental functions that make possible relative psychological "unity" of the self and the certainty of scientific reasoning, the suggestion would be, accordingly, that in order to understand the process through which "the Negro" for Hume may be human but an only inferior kind, we ought to examine his notion of "passive" and "active" reasoning, a notion complementary to, but different from, the functions established for the philosophical relations.<br><br>For Hume philosophic or scientific thinking, "reasoning" proper, consists in the exercise he calls "combination" or comparison of ideas. "Reasoning" in this sense is opposed to mere impression as the active to the passive. The first quality of active reasoning is the ability to render explicit and clear ideas which are by their proper nature implicit and faint. <blockquote>An idea is by its very nature weak and fainter than an impression; but being in every other respect the same, cannot imply any very great mystery. If its weakness render it obscure, ’tis our business to remedy that defect, as much as possible, by keeping the idea steady and precise; and till we have done so, ’tis in vain to pretend to reasoning and philosophy. <b>[6]</b></blockquote>The second quality of distinction for active reasoning is introduced by way of a difference between "thought" and "perception." <blockquote>All kinds of reasoning consist in nothing but <i>comparison</i>, and a discovery of those relations, either constant or inconstant, which two or more objects bear to each other. This comparison we may make, wither when both objects are present to the sense, or when neither of them is present, or when only one. When both the objects are present to the senses along with the relation, we call <i>this</i> perception rather than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or any action, properly speaking, but mere passive admission of the impressions thro’ the organs of the sensation. <b>[7]</b></blockquote><hr><br> 6 Hume, <i>Treatise</i>, 73.<br><br>7 <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><center>694</center></div>
         <div class="footnote" id="15"> We are given therefore three kinds of situations under which the mental processes of reasoning (or "comparison") may, in general, occur: either when both objects compared are physically present, so that the mind, accordingly, registers (compares) them together; when only one of the objects compared is physically present; or finally, when no objects of the combination is physically present, such that the association is purely mental and abstract. Notice that "[w]hen [as in the first case] both the objects are present to the senses along with the relation, we call this perception rather than reasoning; nor is there in this case any exercise of the thought, or any action, properly speaking"; what we have is a case of "mere passive admission of the impression thro’ the organs" of the senses.<br><br>These passages, in addition to showing what is meant by active as opposed to passive processes of mind, reveal that only one type of the three processes of combination may be characterized, unequivocally, as "reasoning" or "exercise of thought ... or ... action." Therefore, when Hume claims that no "Negro" is capable of"eminent ... action or speculation," he is relying on these theoretical assumptions to state that the person is incapable of making active uses of reason. Curiously, this incapacity is supposed to be a "permanent" condition, determined by no less than mother "nature." <b>[8]</b><br><br>As we saw, Hume would not deny all mental, psychological, or cognitive functions to the Negro; he simply insists that in comparison to the white the Negro is naturally endowed with a passive and therefore inferior level of mind. The Negro would lack the realm of higher mental, moral self-constitution as well as the cognitive aptitude for sciences which depend upon ideas ("This is all I think necessary to observe concerning those four relations, which are the foundation of science; ... the other three ... depend not upon ideas" <b>[9]</b>). Because capable of only passive ideas, the Negro enjoys mere perception, passive reception of impression, present in the mind because of simultaneous sensual presence of the objects of the impression. Remove these sensual objects and the Negro mind is at a loss actively to deduce or infer in the abstract the relations among objects, through concepts and logical demonstrations. This would be like a child, but for ever so, who can accurately count the fingers on each and both hands but could not solve mathematical problems such as: 5 + 5 = x; 10 - x = 5; or x + 5 = 10.<br><br>When Hume wrote about animals, he argued that non-human animals are certainly capable of perceiving the sort of relations that demand no combination of ideas. The animals, for example, are capable of mentally establishing the three lower, non-strictly philosophical relations of resemblance, identity, and time and space. But according to Hume, "We ought not to receive as reasoning<br><br>8 When he thought about a counter-example, Hume seemed to protect his theory rather than the evidence: "In JAMAICA ... they talk of one Negro as a man of parts and learning; but ’tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly."<br><br><hr><br> 9 Hume, <i>Treatise</i>, 73.<br><br><center>695</center></div>
          <div class="footnote" id="16">any of the observations we may make concerning identity, and the relation of time and place; since in none of them the mind can go beyond what is immediately present to the senses, either to discover the real existence or the relations of objects." <b>[10]</b> Yet, as we saw, these are nearly all the experience of relation Hume would allow that the Negro race may have as well as the white.<blockquote>There is evidently the same <i>relation</i> of ideas, and derived from the same causes, in the minds of animals as in those of men. A dog that has hid a bone, often forgets the place; but when brought to it, his thought passes easily to what he formerly conceal’d, by means of the contiguity, which produces a relation among his ideas. In like manner, when he has been heartily beat in any place, he will tremble on his approach to it even tho’ he discover no signs of any present danger. The effects of resemblance are not so remarkable, but as that relation makes a considerable ingredient in causation, of which all animals shew so evident a judgment, we may conclude that the three relations of resemblance, and continuity and causation operate in the same manner upon beasts as upon human creatures. <b>[11]</b></blockquote> If the mental capacity of the Negro-which is to say the level of humanity-is more nearly animal than white, is there any reason why the Negro could not be sold like a horse or, to stay with Hume’s example, a dog? Is it possible that Hume added this footnote to the essay "Of National Character" as a statement of principled philosophical position on the debate current at the time in England and America about whether or not the Negro is a legitimate "article of trade." <b>[12]</b><br><br>Furthermore, if Negroes lack naturally and permanently the capacity for self-and social-constitution through the arts and the sciences and through related projects of culture, government, and civilization, then slavery and subsequently colonialism might indeed have been viewed by Hume as forms of containment in defense of civilization, rather than the usually asserted "educational" value of slavery (Hegel) or the "mission to civilize" (Lugard).<br><br><hr><br> 10 <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br>11 Hume, <i>Treatise</i>, 327. Elsewhere Hume is far more explicit: in the section "Of the Reason of Animals," he notes, "experimental reasoning which we possess in common with beasts, and on which the whole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a species of instinct or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to ourselves, and in its chief operations is not directed by any such relations or comparison of ideas as are the proper objects of our intellectual faculties."<br><br>12 According to David Livingston, "Although he [Hume] undertook no substantial literary project during the last decade of his life, he took the opportunity to correct and change new editions of his works <i>in order to address the issues of that period</i>," <i>Philosophical Melancholy and Delirium: Essays in the Philosophy of David Hume</i> (Chicago, 1998), 281, italics added. Could the same motive "to address issues of that period" explain the revisions of the 1748 "Of National Characters"?<br><br><center>696</center></div>
          <div class="footnote" id="17"> <center>Conclusions</center><br><br>One could attempt to offer a different interpretation of Hume on this latter point. "Look," this interpreter might say, "Hume was only suggesting that humans and animals share "brotherly" bonds because they share a good deal of sentiments in common, for nature treats both alike in their sensitive bodiedness." "There are," says Hume himself, "instances of the relation of impressions, sufficient to convince us, that there is a union of certain affections with each other in the inferior species of creatures as well as in the superior." <b>[13]</b> Thus, if both the "superior" and "inferior," human and non-human animals share, i.e., enjoy and suffer, similar emotional and affective life, why should one be concerned that Hume happened to classify the Negro among the "inferior" rather than the "superior" (human) animals? Could not emotions and affections, such as pain, joy, and fear, which Hume states afflict both beast and humans be regarded as a common basis for affirming the "humanity" alike of both white and black peoples? In fact Hume himself seems to point in this direction in his notion of sympathy: the foundation of sympathy is the relation, at the affective levels of perception, between ourselves and others. <b>[14]</b><br><br>This interpretation, however, runs into quite a few hardly surmountable problems. For instance, how could one speak of a common "humanity" between humans and dogs or by extension, in Hume’s philosophy as well, between the whites and blacks-separated by an "original distinction" which "nature had ... made," supposedly as fixed and final as that between humans and animals? To argue that for Hume the black and the white races share a common humanity on the basis of"sympathy" rather than "reason" would be to reject the fuller complexity and consequences of Hume’s theory of mind. Is it conceivable to jettison active "reason" or "mind" or "science" and "art," as basis for a universal humanity, simply because (assuming Hume would say so) "real" human features should consist of passive "sympathy"?<br><br>In summary, if Hume is "apt to suspect the Negroes ... to be naturally inferior to the whites.... No ingenious manufacturers among them, no arts, no sciences...," we should ask: what does this statement mean in light of a detailed exposition and analysis of Hume’s psychology and epistemology? From my view of the question, it seems that the Negro person is capable of"no arts, no science" because the Negro displayed no mental "ingenuity" in culture, manufacture, or, generally, civilization.

          <div class="footnote" id="31"><b>Abstract and Keywords</b><br><br>David Hume in a notorious footnote in “Of National Characters,” in his <i>Essays, Moral, Political and Literary</i>, explicitly wrote that there were human races and that nonwhites were inferior to whites. The footnote has been characterized as “just an offhand comment.” However, the footnote reflects Hume’s deeper views about methodology in the sciences of man, and it can be connected to passages in Hume’s other works and to a broader Scottish and European intellectual and historical setting. Hume consistently insisted on a natural inferiority of blacks which set them apart from other races  and believed that the difference between Europeans and Amerindians was a great as the difference between human beings and animals. He rejected slavery, which rendered his ideology of white supremacy enigmatic, because his rejection of geographical or climatic differences as causes meant that he could not provide a convincing causal account of what he took to be racial difference.<br><br>Keywords: David Hume, human sciences, black inferiority, geography, white supremacy<br><br>IN 1753, David Hume attached a note to his essay “Of National Characters,” which had first appeared five years prior:<blockquote>I am apt to suspect the negroes, and in general all the other species of men (for there are fouror five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized nationof any other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent either in action orspeculation. No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences. On the otherhand, the most rude and barbarous of the whites, such as the ancient GERMAN the presentTARTARS have still something eminent about them, in their valour, form of government, or some other particular. Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so manycountries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men.Not to mention our colonies, there are NEGROE slaves dispersed all over EUROPE, of whichnone ever discovered any symptom of ingenuity; tho’ low people, without education, will startup amongst us, and distinguish themselves in every profession. In JAMAICA, indeed, they talkof one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but ’tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly.</blockquote>(Hume 1985, 629. All references to Hume to www.davidhume.org, except when noted;editorial abbreviations for Hume’s works herein are at http://www.davidhume.org/texts/editorial. html#abbreviations)The note remained in all editions of Hume’s <i>Essays, Moral, Political and Literary</i> until the posthumous edition of 1777, where the first two lines were rewritten to restrict the inferior breeds of men to just those of African descent:<blockquote>I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites. There scarcely ever wasa civilized nation of that complexion, nor even any individual eminent either in action orspeculation. (NC [M])</blockquote>It is a very brief, but carefully worded, synoptic, and disquieting statement of Hume’s views on race from the time that he wrote and published the <i>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</i> to his death. It is disturbing, both in its content and in the fact that it was the persistent, and one assumes considered, view of a philosopher who was and is an avatar of Enlightenment and who is often looked upon as a secular saint and a model of character. Still, should we care any more about what David Hume wrote and thought about race than about his views on many other subjects that are not central to what we understand as his importance as a philosopher? And if we do indeed care about Hume’s thought about race,</div>
          <div class="footnote" id="32"><b>(p. 32)</b> should we care about what Hume thought on these issues any more than we do about other philosophers? In this essay we will answer “Yes” to both these questions. We will attempt to contextualize Hume’s views both in terms of Hume’s oeuvre and also Scottish and European views on race and human differences.<br><br><b>Uniformity and Variation in the Sciences of Man</b><br><br>The note added to the “National Characters” has been the subject of a protracted and heated historiographic <i>querelle</i> ever since Richard Popkin commented on Hume’s “shocking racism” in 1973 (Popkin 1973). He argued that the Enlightenment’s “paradox,” the “innocence” of which he aimed to unmask, was that from the very heart of the Enlightenment’s universalistic conception of man sprang the nucleus of Western racist ideology. Even if Hume’s note might be considered as a “casual addition,” which held and expressed “the prejudices of the time,” as Popkin stated a few years later, its legacy as ”the rallying point of the polygenetic racists” was profound (Popkin 1977-1978, 1992). Since Popkin, there have been a growing number of discussions of Hume’s views on race as well as the racial theories of Scottish philosophers, and of philosophers more generally (examples, from a rapidlyincreasing literature, include Gates 1985, 10-11; lmmerwahr 1992; Gliozzi 1993; Palter 1995; Eze 2000, 2001; Garrett 2000, 2004; Zack 2002; Mankin 2009; Sebastiani2013).There are a number of questions that arise in relation to this subliterature. How unique was Hume’s view compared with the views of other British and Continental philosophers? And how connected was his brief discussion of race with his other, more extensively argued-for philosophical commitments?<br><br>It is unsurprising that Scottish philosophers of the eighteenth century were interested in race. Many of the best-known Scottish philosophers-Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, Lord Kames, and so on—viewed themselves as putting philosophy and more particularly the moral sciences on a new and better footing by centering them on the sciences of man. As Hume noted in <i>A Treatise of Human  Nature</i>,these reforms of the moral sciences (which included most areas of philosophy other than natural philosophy, including epistemology, mind, moral philosophy proper, political philosophy, and aesthetics) paralleled Lord Bacon’s reforms of natural philosophy (T lntro. 7; SBN xvi-xvii). Bacon envisioned that the collection, comparison, and analysis of natural history and experiment would provide a proper footing for a new natural science (Bacon 2000, 222-232). The transformation of natural philosophy, the expansion of its scope and power, and the growth of its efficacy for human happiness all made good onthis promissory note. In the “Introduction” to <i>A Treatise</i>, Hume claimed his own reform of the moral sciences would have if anything even greater results (T lntro.7; SBN xvi-xvii), and Hume and other Scottish philosophers sought to transform the moral sciences accordingly. Where Bacon drew on natural experiments and observations, the Scottish philosophers who were invested in the sciences of man (and who had different conceptions of it from Hume despite broad shared goals) were interested in a broad swath of observations of human experience, including travelers’ reports and histories (Carey 2006). These could provide comparative “experiments” once suitably criticized and compared for discerning what were the stable and persistent features of human nature. Hume’s </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="33"><b>(p. 33)</b> discourse on equality and difference was based on the relationship between the “general” and the “local” uniformities of human nature—as Duncan Forbes has suggested (Forbes 1975, 116-117). His reflection on national characters was incorporated within the broader theory of the necessary connection between motives and human actions. As Hume announced in “A Dialogue,” which was appended to <i>the Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</i> and which appeared in the same year as the footnote in 1753 (Falkenstein and McArthur 2013):<br><br><blockquote>By tracing matters, replied I, a little higher, and examining the first principles, which each nation establishes, of blame or censure. The Rhine flows north, the Rhone south; yet bothspring from the <i>same</i> mountain, and are also actuated, in their opposite directions, by the<i>same</i> principle of gravity. The different inclinations of the ground, on which they run, cause allthe difference in their courses. (M Dial 26)</blockquote>If the relationship between uniformity and diversity could be comparable to the opposite course of two rivers, the problem was then to discover what was mountain, what was gravity, and what was due to the differing inclinations of the ground. This could only be discerned through a wide-reaching cross-cultural and cross-historical comparison. Within this framework, diversity became, first of all, the product of history: over time, the characters of nations varied, together with the manners and virtues of individuals. Hume’s diachronic approach reshaped the difference in culture and society as a historical distance. Given the uniformity of the principles of human nature, sympathy and imitation were the constant, universal causes that explained the variety of national characters together with accidental and historic factors.<br><br>Many Scottish philosophers such as Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, and Lord Kames subscribed to a similar framework, although they put different weight on different causes. Even outliers like the Platonist Lord Monboddo, who held strong innatist and antiempiricist positions about mind and metaphysics, also utilized comparative analyses of “experiments” in some areas of philosophy. A problem for all was how to distinguish gravity from the peculiarities of the ground, how to distinguish ubiquitous properties of human nature from idiosyncratic customs or deformations of human nature. Hume’s “A Dialogue” highlights this problem and points to a means for dealing with it. The work begins with a Swiftian fantasy where Hume’s narrator describes a land called Fourli “whose inhabitants have ways of thinking, in many things, particularly in morals, diametrically opposite to ours” (M Dial 2; SBN 324 ). Hume then reveals that this “land” is in fact just a report of well-known historical actions in Ancient Greece and Rome. We fail to see how different their moral practices are from our own because of the lustre we add to  their actions due to our admirations for Ancient Greeks and Romans. But the example points to the enormous diversity of human moral conventions and practices. But Hume argues, the differences are not as large as might be at first:<br><br>The principles upon which men reason in morals are always the same; though the conclusionswhich they draw are often very different. That they all reason aright with regard to this subject,more than with regard to any other, it is not incumbent on any moralist to show. It is sufficient,that the original principles of censure or blame are uniform, and that erroneous conclusi<onscan be corrected by sounder reasoning and a larger experience. (M Dial 36; SBN 335-336)<blockquote>These principles are useful and agreeableness to self and others. Conventions for and against suicide, for example, may differ drastically, but the reasons for them are ultimately couched </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="34"><b>(p. 34)</b> and justified in terms of this set of shared principles. “Particular accidents may, at one time, make any one of them flow with greater abundance than at another” (M Dial 42; SBN 337-338), so the free commerce of men and women which is agreeable may result in giving up some utility, presumably of knowing whose children are whose.</blockquote>There are many causes of variations in customs, including geography, government, and the persistence of contingent customs. This last can give rise to what Hume calls an artificial life, when superstitious religious principles or (more rarely) extreme philosophical principles give rise to rigid rules of behavior that countervene or undermine natural sociability and agreeable and useful qualities. This is Hume’s attempt to criticize some of the ways that we respond to, or fail to respond to, our shared moral principles in our ways of living. To extend Hume’s analogy, artificial lives dam the flow of the Rhine and the Rhone, as opposed to letting them flow, to the detriment of both happiness and morality. <br><br>However, this analysis assumes that all of the peoples have roughly equal access to what is  agreeable and useful. We would like to suggest that a puzzle for Hume was how to deal with peoples for whom the experimental report of their practices seems to have little evidence of either utility or agreeableness. One answer, suggested by the discussion of artificial lives, was that the persistent disutility and disagreeableness was due to the effect of rigid customs—for example, religious rules—that dammed up natural sociability and with it the natural affections that gave rise to and allowed recognition of the useful and agreeable. But what if there were social differences that were not amenable to this sort of explanation? This brings us to race. The word “race” had many meanings in eighteenth-century philosophy. It was often used interchangeably with “species” or “tribe,” associated with “nation,” while being still akin to “lineage” or “stock,” and was central to natural historical discussions of animals and plants. Hume, and others, drew on the field of natural history when using the term to discuss human populations, although, like many others as well, he used the term in different senses in his works. We will focus on the natural historical sense as applied to human populations.<br><br><b>Natural Causes, Moral Causes, and Racial Differences</b><br><br>Hume originally published “Of National Characters” in 1748, five years before he added the footnote. The essay considers the source and nature of the stereotypes and generalizations about character that we ascribe to different national types as well as to the sexes, ages, and professions (soldier, priest): to employ again Forbes’s apt definition, these were “local uniformities” into which the uniformity of human nature was split. There was a long tradition, which persisted through Montesquieu, Buffon, and beyond, that viewed human diversity as the consequence of the climatic difference. But Hume sought in “Of National Characters” to explain human difference solely in terms of what he termed <i>moral</i> causes: <blockquote>By <i>moral</i> causes, I mean all circumstances, which are fitted to work on the mind as motives or reasons, and which render a peculiar set of manners habitual to us. Of this kind are, the nature of the government, the revolutions of public affairs, the plenty or penury in which the people live, the situation of the nation with regard to its neighbours, and such like circumstances. By <i>physical</i> causes I mean those qualities of the air and climate, which are supposed to work </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="35"><b>(p. 35)</b> insensibly on the temper, by altering the tone and habit of the body, and giving a particular complexion, which, though reflection and reason may sometimes overcome it, will yet prevail among the generality of mankind, and have an influence on their manners. (NC 2)</blockquote>For Hume both moral and physical causes can be natural causes, that is not supernatural, not artificial, and ubiquitous (T 3.1.2.7-1 0; SBN 473-475; EPM Note QQ; SBN 307). Many of the moral causes he was most interested in were artificial but not supernatural, ubiquitous in operation, but not in consequences (hence diversity). The distinction between moral and physical causes is both a distinction between the nature of the causes and between the consequences of the causes. Moral causes are human <i>circumstances</i>, whereas physical causes are physical <i>qualities</i> that act on humans but exist and act independently of them (air and climate). Hume placed “plenty or penury” among the moral causes, although it seems on the border between moral and physical causes (we will discuss “plenty or penury” further later on). The habits that moral causes give rise to are <i>changeable</i> and <i>local</i> (but the needs to which the habits minister are often universal), whereas physical causes give rise to <i>relatively</i> <i>permanent </i>and <i>universal</i> features of human populations.<br><br>Hume tried to show that moral causes were sufficient to explain the diversity of characters (NC 7) and to defuse counterexamples that seemed to need recourse to physical causes for explanation. Peoples who lived near the Arctic (e.g., the Lapps) and near the Equator (e.g., Africans) seemed to pose problems for the theory. The passage to which the footnote with which we began this essay is appended asserts that:<blockquote>If the characters of men depended on the air and climate, the degrees of heat and cold should naturally be expected to have a mighty influence; since nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational animals. And indeed there is some reason to think, that all the nations, which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics, are inferior to the rest of the species, and are incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind. The poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and the indolence of the southern, from their few necessities, may, perhaps, account for this remarkable difference, without our having recourse to <i>physical</i> causes. This however is certain, that the characters of nations are very promiscuous [i.e., disordered or random-AG & SS] in the temperate climates, and that almost all the general observations, which have been formed of the more southern or more northern people in these climates, are found to be uncertain and fallacious. (NC 20)</blockquote>This passage corresponded almost word for word to the end of the essay “Of Commerce,” published in <i>Political Discourses</i> in 1752, which rhetorically asked why none of the peoples in the tropics were capable of any art, of achieving public order in government, or of military discipline (Co 21 ). One reason given in both essays was indolence, linked to the fewer needs and the abundance of natural products in the tropical countries. In “Of National Characters,” Hume attempted to show that widely held beliefs about the effects of physical causes on characters in extreme climes are fallacious, namely that “the northern regions have a greater inclination to strong liquors, and those in the southern to love and women.” Southern peoples have equal inclinations to strong liquors, and “when ALEXANDER led the GREEKS into PERSIA, a still more southern climate, they multiplied their debauches of this kind, in imitation of the PERSIAN manners” (NC 32). Hume then goes on to add:<blockquote>But supposing the fact true, that nature, by physical principles, has regularly distributed these two passions, the one to the northern, the other to the southern regions; we can only infer, that </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="36"><b>(p. 36)</b> the climate may affect the grosser and more bodily organs of our frame; not that it canwork upon those finer organs, on which the operations of the mind and understanding depend.(NC 34)</blockquote>In other words, the climate affects the senses but not human minds and understanding, and it is the latter that is identified with whatever are the distinctive and uniting properties of human nature. But, given Hume’s strict empiricism, we have a problem. Hume holds that ideas are derivative of the sense impressions and the passions (i.e., secondary impressions). How can we distinguish between a group of people that has permanently diminished operations of the mind and understanding due to the qualitative actions of climate and those who have consistently diminished content on which the mind and understanding operate due to moral causes?<br><br>Hume concludes the passage cited earlier with a suggestion of how to distinguish between these two possibilities: “The races of animals never degenerate when carefully tended; and horses, in particular, always show their blood in their shape, spirit, and swiftness: But a coxcomb may beget a philosopher; as a man of virtue may leave a worthless progeny” (NC 34 ). Physical causes (blood) give rise to characteristics of races (“shape, spirit, and swiftness”). Race characteristics remain present  under good conditions; that is, the penury of circumstances cannot be a plausible explanation of mental or physical impairment. The problem remains though that it is difficult to make a judgment as to what is a race characteristic and what is an impermanent consequence of circumstances from observing peoples in impoverished climates because there is no recourse to good conditions. <br><br>Hume offers another consideration. If a quality does not persist through generations, then it is not a race characteristic. In the footnote Hume suggests further evidence as well as a test to show that some of the characteristics of peoples who live far north or south of Britain are racial. First, there is evidence that there is “no ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences.” If we were dealing with a moral cause, we might expect that it could be overcome gradually when a coxcomb occasionally begets a philosopher. But this does not happen in the antipodes, whereas it has in other rude nations.<br><br>This evidence is unconvincing because it is evidence of the <i>lack</i> of a quality. Consistent and extreme action of the climate resulting in extreme penury might still stop even occasional progress in the arts and sciences from arising, but the lack of progress is fully explained by climate. Consequently Hume offers a second transplantation test:<blockquote>NEGROE slaves dispersed all over EUROPE, of which none ever discovered any symptom of ingenuity; tho’ low people, without education, will start up amongst us, and distinguish themselves in every profession. In JAMAICA, indeed, they talk of one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but ’tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly. (NC [M].1)</blockquote>Hume is here contrasting a class distinction with a racial distinction. The distinction between low and high people is due to moral causes because low people will progress. But no “NEGROE slaves” will progress even when their circumstances are shifted and the impairments of climate (Africa or the Caribbean to Europe) and circumstances (slave to nonslave) are offset. Hume concludes that the characteristics that make for differences between whites and all the other species of men, and then just whites and blacks, are racial and not due to moral causes.<br><br>A question remains open: who are, aside from the Africans, the “four or five different kinds” or “species” that he mentioned in 1753-1754? In a passage of <i>An Enquiry Concerning</i> </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="373"><b>(p. 37)</b> <i>the Principles of Morals</i>, Hume directly referred to the red-skinned (in Linnaeus’s classification) Amerindians—isolated as a separate species in the course of over a century of polygenetic discourse (Gliozzi 1977; Popkin, 1987). Developing a reasoning ad absurdum intended to demonstrate that justice was an artificial, conventional, and social virtue relating to public utility, and not to any transcendental principle, Hume imagined the existence of a “species of creatures intermingled with men, which, though rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body and mind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon the highest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment”(SBN 190-191). Hume argued that their servile obedience and inability to resist meant that it would be impossible for such creatures to achieve the degree of equality required to establish a society. Men were  tied to this different “rational species” by the capacity for compassion—the laws of humanity together with sympathy for natural virtues such as kindness—but not, strictly speaking, by any bond of justice (Moore 1976; Levy and Peart 2004). Due to such an unequal relationship, firmly established in nature, these beings would not possess any right or property.<br><br>The thought experiment from the <i>Enquiry</i> is extremely difficult to interpret, but it is clear that Hume sought to interrelate the matchless disparity that separated men from animals, males from females, and civilized Europeans from Amerindian savages (see Sebastiani 2013, 36-38, 120-123, 149-150). As a result, the immense historic superiority of the Europeans over the Amerindians, placed between the natural difference of humans to animals and men to women, was made into a natural distinction, and the American species was identified as the “other rational species.” <br><br><b>Contexts for Hume’s Footnote</b><br><br>The historical situation that Hume described was the reality of the colonies. But Hume’s  discourse on national characters had become intertwined with theoretical issues of the universal and particular rules of human nature: moral factors of differentiation, such as time, experience, and education, acted upon differential intellectual capacities and varied dominant passions from the outset. Prior to the sociological causes lay a natural difference between separate segments of humanity, seen as “local uniformities," which the note added in 1753-1754 to “Of National Characters” sought to make explicit. In this sense, we agree with Emmanuel Eze that Hume’s footnote was “rooted both in Hume’s epistemology and in his political thought” (Eze 2000, 53). How should we understand Hume’s discussions of race in the context both of Scottish discussions of race and human diversity and those on the continent? What can this context tell us about Hume’s decision, five years after the initial publication, to add this footnote and to make a point explicit that everywhere else remained implicit? And why did he decide to change his note and limit the target to the opposition between blacks and whites?<br><br>We will attempt to answer these questions by placing the note within the framework of the ongoing Enlightenment debates about national characters, political economy, and the natural history of humankind. Two contexts are particularly important. First, the references to blacks and to  Amerindians appeared at roughly the same time, in the years immediately following the publication of the <i>Esprit des lois</i> and the beginning of Hume’s correspondence </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="38"><b>(p. 38)</b> with Montesquieu (Montesquieu 1950-1955, Vol. 3, 1230-1231, 1217-1222, 1255. See Mazza 2002, 27-32). Montesquieu argued very influentially that climatic differences were sufficient to explain the diversity of peoples, why some peoples tended naturally to servitude and indolence and others to liberty and progress (Montesquieu, 1950). Second, Buffon’s <i>Histoire Naturelle</i> began to appear in 1749 as a scientific alternative to Linnaeus’ <i>Systema Naturae</i>, providing a precise definition of “race” and “species.”<br><br>The essay on “National Characters” and the first <i>Enquiry</i> both appeared in 1748, like the <i>Esprit des lois</i>. The second <i>Enquiry</i> came out in 1751: it contained both the reasoning on the different rational species and “A Dialogue,” which, added in the second 1753 edition, was construed as a deliberate echo of Montesquieu’s <i>Lettres persanes</i>, also including Usbeck as one of its characters (Montesquieu 1950-1955). The note on race was added in the second edition of “National Characters,” published in  1753-1754 in the <i>Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</i>. The query that Hume raised at the Select Society of Edinburgh in December 1754, “Whether the Difference of national characters be chiefly owing to the Nature of different Climates, or to moral and political causes” (Mossner 1980, 281-282), indicates his continuing engagement in a critical dialogue with Montesquieu.<br><br>In the meantime, Hume quarreled with Robert Wallace about population, which Wallace, reaffirming the current orthodoxy also supported by Montesquieu, believed to have been greater in the ancient nations (Wallace 1753). A strong point of Hume’s argument, which he developed in the essay “Of the Populousness of Ancient Nations,” published in <i>Political Discourses</i> in 1752, dealt with slavery; Humeviewedslaveryasthegreatestdividebetweenancientsandmoderneconomies, and the most consistent proof of the advantage of modernity. The civil development of Europe had created a humanity that could no longer accept the treatment of other peoples like animals, insofar as it  accepted progressive mores emphasizing benevolence and sympathy. This did not alter, in Hume’s reasoning on justice in the <i>Enquiry</i>, the natural inferiority of nonwhites based on moral difference, which explained the Europeans’ exploitation of them. And contra Montesquieu, Hume’s discussion of moral causes had shown not only how liberty changed from one climate to another, and from one age to another, but also how it had developed in a world of men historically and naturally separated by hierarchical divisions. The reform of the slave system in the free labor market, that would emerge fully in the final revision of his essay on “populousness” in 1777, favored liberty and humanity, but it did not impinge upon the natural hierarchy of peoples.<br><br>Consequently, Hume rejected the prison of climate where Montesquieu had confined some peoples, but he evoked an undercurrent of natural diversity, which logically preceded any cultural or sociological explanation. This sided Hume with the supporters of polygenesis and brought him very close to Voltaire, who, while maintaining the primacy of moral causes, was the most active Enlightenment supporter of separate original creations for different races, which he positioned within the context of a larger historic analysis (Duchet 1971; Gliozzi 1979). The choice to use the terms “species,” “kinds,” “breeds,” and "races” as synonyms also suggests proximity to Voltaire, and a rejection of Buffon’s new definition of species as a “constant succession of individuals endowed with the power of reproduction,” which unified humankind and took racial differentiations as mere exterior marks, impressed by the climate on the body (Buffon 1749-1789, Vol. 14, 311-312; Vol. 2, 10-11; Vol. 3, 530; Vol. 4, 385-386. See Sebastiani 2013). It was to respond to both Montesquieu and Buffon that Hume made an idea explicit that had been lurking in the 1748 edition of his essay. Hume had stated that though “temper and understanding" were to be considered as common ingredients of </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="39"><b>(p. 39)</b> the whole humankind, “nature” had distributed them in different portions, conferring a specific “tincture to the national character” (NC 9; see Forbes 1975, 111 ). The addition of the footnote not only confirmed that physical causes, general or particular, had no impact in human affairs, but it specified the intervention of a moral cause of natural origin: the difference <i>ab origine</i> of rational capacities between the human races. As a result, the analysis of national characters as the consequence of culture and thereby changeable was limited to European peoples alone, stressed by reference to original polygenetic distinctions made by nature. It remains unclear, however, as Naomi Zack has pointed out, whether Hume used “species” meaning “races,” or considered the nonwhite “breeds of men” so different from the white breed as to need different principles in order to account for their cultural development (Zack 2002, 13-18). In either case, Hume did not give empirical ground to his claim. Furthermore, his racial views seemed to contradict the assertion, put at the outset in “Of Populousness of Ancient Nations,” that “there is no universal difference discernible in the human species” (PA 1 ).<br><br><b>“Learn, Mr. Hume ...”: The Response by Contemporaries</b><br><br>How was the note taken up by Hume’s contemporaries? And to what extent did Hume take these reactions into consideration? Because it is impossible to retrace the huge debate on this issue here, developing in Britain, across the Atlantic, and on the European continent—of which Kant’s comment is just one well-known example (Zack 2002, 9-24}—we will discuss a few select responses that Hume directly engaged in the final years of his life. Hume’s contemporary Lord Kames’s massive and rambling <i>Sketches of the History of Man</i> (1774, expanded in 1778) can be read as a comprehensive commentary on Hume’s note. Kames claimed, even more than Hume, that the internal disposition and nature of peoples were not explicable merely in terms of climate, culture, or education, but depended on a “constant and invariable,” that is natural, “cause.” Just as (contra Buffon) the phenotypically diverse breeds of dogs could not conceivably derive from a single shepherd-dog, so, too, there were men of different “species” or “kinds”—terms that, following Hume and Voltaire, Kames used synonymously. Within “each kind,” individuals displayed a remarkable uniformity but also differed “no less remarkably from the individuals of every other kind.” Echoing the terms of Hume’s footnote, Kames  concluded that "uniformity without variation is the offspring of nature, never of chance” (Kames 1778, Vol. 1, 7 4 ). Kames, like Hume, opposed slavery, but, notably and unlike Hume, his fragmentation of humanity did not necessarily imply the superiority of one species.<br><br>The publication, also in 1774, of the <i>History of Jamaica</i> by the planter Edward Long showed another possible political implication of Hume’s racial footnote. Long quoted Hume in order to claim the inferiority of Africans and to defend slavery. Paraphrasing Hume, Long depicted blacks as the exemplification of a species “almost incapable of making any progress in civility or science” (Long 1774, Vol. 2, 353). Philanthropism, against which the planter Long reacted in the name of the prosperity of the British Empire, had found early expression in James Beattie’s <i>An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth</i>, published in 1770. Beattie </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="40"><b>(p. 40)</b> considered “the superiority of white men over black” as an expression of Hume’s skepticism, which he strongly refuted. Following a line of discussion developed at the Philosophical Society or Wise Club of Aberdeen, of which he was member, Beattie defended a uniform and universalist history of humankind. The Society, which met regularly between 1757 and 1773, consisted of Aberdeen university professors, including Thomas Reid, John Gregory, George Campbell, Alexander Gerard, and James Dunbar, who engaged in a heated debate about Hume’s philosophy (see Ulman 1990; Conrad 1987). Hume was also brought to the bar by the Wise Club for his footnote. The key question (n. 96), posed by Beattie on March 22 and May 10, 1768, concerned the problem of the supposed European superiority over the rest of the world, which prompted the idea that Europe was populated by a distinct species. Question 96 read “Whether that superiority of understanding, by which the inhabitants of Europe and of the nations immediately adjoining imagine themselves to be distinguished, may not easily be accounted for, without supposing the rest of mankind of an inferior species?” As the manuscript shows, the crucial concern for the members of the Wise Club was to unmask the social and cultural dangers of polygenist hypotheses. The answer they provided was a full condemnation of Hume: “Learn, Mr. Hume, to prize the blessings of Liberty and Education, for I will venture to assure you that had you been born and bred a slave, your Genius, whatever you may think of it, would never have been heard of” (AUL, Ms 540, item no. 20, fol. 14r. See Sebastiani 2013, ch. 4). Such a criticism, which contributed to the formation of an antislavery movement in Aberdeen, led to the defense of the unity of humankind on the basis of a strong emphasis on environmental and social circumstances.<br><br>Parallel to this Scottish controversy, in continental Europe a general shift took place toward the study of physical man in natural history in the 1770s (Moravia 1970). This deep reconfiguration of the  debate pushed Hume to modify his assertion about the existence of four or five different species in the note. The substitution of “never” with “scarcely ever” was perhaps a sign that Hume was willing to acknowledge the possibility that there had existed forms of civilization even among blacks (Palter 1995). This has sometimes been interpreted as a concession to Beattie and the members of the Wise Club, as John lmmerwahr does (lmmerwahr 1992, but see Garrett 2000). Hume, though, continued to insist on, and even reinforced, the natural inferiority of blacks. His revision of the note converged with the clear separation of the fate of blacks from that of other “species,” especially the Amerindians, which Beattie, by contrast, had put together in order to demonstrate their equal and universal potential for civil development (Beattie 1770, 479-482).<br><br>Once the reference to other species was dropped, blacks remained isolated in their lack of spiritual and material development. The highly disparaging passage comparing the cases of educated persons of African descent, such as Francis Williams or Philip Quaque, to parrots, also remained unchanged, whereas Beattie had referred to them as proof of the intellectual capacity of blacks. If, then, in 1777 Hume abstained from enumerating the different humanities, in the overall economy of the note, the response to Beattie’s criticisms was essentially negative. Maintaining the thesis of an original and natural distinction between diverse “breeds of men,” the polygenetic inclination of Hume’s reasoning remained implicit, in line with the criticism of climate theories in the whole essay on “National Characters."<br><br>However, polygenesis and the ideology of slavery were not necessarily related, as Beattie had made them appear. But the criticism of slavery by a polygenist like Hume followed another line. Rather than being based on the notion of the original equality of humankind, as attested by the Christian paradigm, it presumed the existence of a natural hierarchy of </div>
          <div class="footnote" id="41"><b>(p. 41)</b> capacities among peoples. Moving beyond slavery was the direct result of the refinement of European morality, and therefore of a historical process, not the voluntary affirmation of an established and eternally valid principle.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>From this excursus, two points emerge as crucial. First, the note to “Of National Characters” cannot be considered philosophically insignificant insofar as it is connected with Hume’s central ideas about moral and natural causes. In addition to drawing on an already existing essay, Hume’s maintenance of the note through all of the lifetime editions of his Essays, and careful revisions—despite convincing criticisms—strongly suggest that the ideas it expressed mattered to Hume. Second, it is not possible to isolate Hume’s racial observations from the ongoing debate about national characters, the natural history of humankind, and political economy, which was at the heart of the European Enlightenment. One thing this debate shows us is that Hume’s ideas about race were not shared by many of his less philosophically notable contemporaries.<br><br>There is a tendency when dealing with important philosophers to ignore or sideline their beliefs when we find them repellent and to trumpet them when they correspond to beliefs that we hold to be correct. In the former case we hold them to be unphilosophical additions and in the latter philosophical consequences of well-formed views. This makes for bad apologist history and bad philosophy. For this reason alone, it is important to highlight the cases when undeniably great philosophers held considered beliefs that we hold to be morally repugnant and which they thought followed from what we hold to be some of their important philosophical achievements. Hume’s case is by no means unique. It is also important to recognize that these positions often have an afterlife due to the esteem in which these figures are rightly held.<br><br><b>References</b><br><br>Bacon, Francis.
