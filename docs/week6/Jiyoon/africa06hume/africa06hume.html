            <a>David Hume</a>, “Of National Characters” (1748, 1754 and 1776), General
            and Particular (multivolume <a>work</a> published between 1748-1808); from
            Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ed., Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader
            (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2007), 32-33.
          </h3>
          <p>
            … are <a>fitted to live</a> in all climates, such as dogs, horses,
            etc. do not attain the same perfection in all. The courage of
            bull-dogs and game-cocks seems peculiar to England. <a>Flanders</a> is
            remarkable for large and heavy horses, Spain for horses light, and
            of good mettle. Any breed of these creatures, transplanted from one
            country to another, will soon lose the qualities, which they derived
            from their native climate. It may be asked, why not the same with
            men? <p>There are few questions more curious than this, or which will
            more often occur in our inquiries concerning human affairs; and
            therefore it may be proper to give it a full examination.</p>
            <a>The human mind is of a very imitative nature</a>; nor is it
            possible for any set of men to converse often together, without
            acquiring a similitude of manners and communicating to each other
            their vices as well as virtues. The propensity to company and
            society is strong in all rational creatures; and the same
            disposition, which gives us this propensity, makes us enter deeply
            into each other’s sentiments, and causes like passions and
            inclinations to run, as it were, by contagion, through that whole
            club or knot of companions. Where a number of men are united into
            one political body the occasions of their intercourse must be so
            frequent, for defense, commerce and government, that, together with
            the same speech or language, they must acquire a resemblance in
            their manners, and have a common or national character, as well as a
            personal one, peculiar to each individual. Now though nature
            produces all kinds of temper and understanding in great abundance,
            it does not follow, that <a>she</a> always produces them in like
            proportions and that in every society the ingredients of industry
            and indolence, valour and cowardice, humanity and brutality, wisdom
            and folly, will be mixed after the same manner. In the infancy of
            society, if any of these dispositions be found in greater abundance
            than the rest, it will naturally prevail in the compositions and
            give a tincture to the national character ...
          </p>

          <p>
            If the <a>characters of men</a> depended on the air and climate, the
            degrees of heat and cold should naturally be expected to have a
            mighty influence;
            <a
              >since nothing has a greater effect on all plants and irrational
              animals.</a
            >
            And indeed there is some reason to think, that all the nations,
            which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics, are
            inferior to the rest of the species, and are
            <a>incapable of all the higher attainments of the human mind.</a>
            The poverty and misery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and
            the indolence of the southern from their few necessities, may,
            perhaps, account for this remarkable difference, without our having
            recourse to physical causes. This however is certain, that the
            characters of nations are very promiscuous in the temperate
            climates, and that almost all the general observations, which have
            been formed of the more southern or more northern people in these
            climates, are found to be uncertain and fallacious. [In a footnote:]
            I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general
            <a
              >all other species of men (for there are four or five different
              kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites.</a
            >
            <a
              >There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than
              white, nor even any individual eminent either in action or
              speculation.</a
            >
            No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no sciences. On the
            other hand, the most rude and barbarous of the whites, such as the
            ancient Germans, the present Tartars, have still something eminent
            about them, in their valour, form of government, or some other
            particular. Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen,
            in so many countries and ages
            <a
              >if nature had not made an original distinction between these
              breeds of men.</a
            >
            Not to mention our colonies, there are negroe slaves dispersed all
            over Europe, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity;
            though low people without education will start up amongst us and
            distinguish themselves in every profession. In
            <a>Jamaica, indeed,</a> they talk of one negroe as a man of parts
            and learning; but it is likely he is admired for slender
            accomplishments, <a>like a parrot</a> who speaks a few words plainly
            (end of footnote]…
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord BACON has observed, that the
            <a>inhabitants of the south are, in general, more ingenious than
              those of the north</a>; but that, where the native of a cold climate has genius, he rises
            to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits. This
            observation a later writer confirms, by comparing the southern wits
            to cucumbers, which are commonly all good in their kind; but at best
            are an insipid fruit; while the northern geniuses are like melons,
            of which not one in fifty is good; but when it is so, it has an
            exquisite relish. I believe this remark may be allowed just, when
            confined to the European nations…

          seems to be a justification, not an answer resulted from a
          well-constructed logic, for the Europeans' hierarchical perception of
