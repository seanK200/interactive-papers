          <p><b><i>Letter to the Directory, October 28, 1797</i></b></p>
          <p>
            If, upon the arrival of the [investigating] Commission [from
            France], St. Domingue groaned under a military government, this
            power was not in the hands of the blacks; they were subordinate to
            it, and they only executed the orders of General Laveaux. These were
            the blacks who, when France was threatened with the loss of this
            Colony, employed their arms and their weapons to conserve it, to
            reconquer the greatest part of its territory that treason had handed
            over to the Spanish and English.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such was the conduct of those blacks in whose hands citizen Vienot
            Vaublanc said the military government of St. Domingue found itself,
            such are those negroes he accuses of being ignorant and gross;
            undoubtedly they are, because without education there can only be
            ignorance and grossness. But must one impute to them the crime of
            this educational deficiency or, more correctly, accuse those who
            prevented them by the most atrocious punishments from obtaining it?
            And are only <a>civilized people</a> capable of distinguishing between good
            and evil, of having notions of charity and justice? The men of St.
            Domingue have been deprived of an education; but even so, they no
            longer remain in a state of nature, and because they haven’t arrived
            at the degree of perfection that education bestows, they do not
            merit being classed apart from the rest of mankind, being confused
            with animals. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Undoubtedly, one can reproach the inhabitants of St. Domingue,
            including the blacks, for many faults, even terrible crimes. But eve
            in France, where the limits of sociability are clearly drawn,
            doesn’t one see its inhabitants, in the struggle between despotism
            and liberty, going to all the excesses for which the blacks are
            reproached by their enemies? The fury of the two parties has been
            equal in St. Domingue; and if the excesses of the blacks in these
            critical moments haven’t exceeded those committed in Europe, must
            not an impartial judge pronounce in favor of the former?
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is our enemies themselves who present us as ignorant and
            gross, aren’t we more excusable than those who, unlike us, were not
            deprived of the advantages of education and civilization? Surrounded
            by fierce enemies, oft cruel masters; without any other support than
            the charitable intentions of the friends of freedom in France, of
            whose existence we were hardly aware; driven to excessive errors by
            opposing parties who were rapidly destroying each other; knowing, at
            first, only the laws of the Mother-Country that favored the
            pretensions of our enemies and, since our liberty, receiving only
            the semiyearly or yearly instructions of our government, and no
            assistance, but almost always slanders or diatribes from our old
            oppressors—how can we not be pardoned some moments of ill-conduct,
            some gross faults, of which we were the first victims? Why, above
            all, reflect upon unreproachable men, upon the vast majority of the
            blacks, the faults of the lesser part, who, in time, had been
            reclaimed by the attentions of the majority to order and respect for
            the superior authorities?...
          </p>
          <p>
            If General Rochambeau had reflected philosophically on the course of
            events, especially those of the human spirit, he would not find it
            so astonishing that the laws of liberty and equality were not
            precisely established in an American country whose connection with
            the Mother Country had been neglected for so long; he would have
            felt that at a time when Europeans daily perjured themselves by
            handing over their quarters to the enemies of their country,
            prudence dictated that Government entrust its defense to the men of
            color and blacks whose interests were intimately linked to the
            triumph of the Republic; he would have felt that the military
            government then ruling the colony, by giving great power to the
            district commanders, could have led them astray in the labyrinths of
            uncertainty resulting from the absence of laws; he would have
            recalled that Martinique, defended by Europeans, fell prey to the
            English, whereas, St. Domingue, defended by the blacks and men of
            color whom Rochambeau accuses, remained constantly faithful to
            France.
          </p>
          <p><b><i>
            Letter to the Minister of Marine, April 13, 1799
          </p></b></i>
          The first successes obtained in Europe by the partisans of liberty
          over the agents of despotism were not slow to ignite the sacred fire
          of patriotism in the souls of all Frenchmen in St. Domingue. At that
          time, men’s hopes turned to France, whose first steps toward her
          regeneration promised them a happier future; ... they [the French
          colonists] wanted to escape from their arbitrary government, but they
          did not intend the revolution to destroy either the prejudice that
          debased the men of color or the slavery of the blacks, whom they held
          in dependency by the strongest law. In their opinion, the benefits of
          the French regeneration were only for them. They proved it by their
          obstinate refusal to allow the people of color to enjoy their
          political rights and the slaves to enjoy the liberty that they
          claimed. Thus, while the white were erecting another form of
          government upon the rubble of despotism, the men of color and the
          blacks united themselves in order to claim their political existence;
          the resistance of the former having become stronger, it was necessary
          for the latter to rise up in order to obtain [political recognition]
          by force of arms. The whites, fearing that this legitimate resistance
          would bring general liberty to St. Domingue, sought to separate the
          men of color from the cause of the blacks in accordance with
          Machiavelli’s principle of divide and rule. Renouncing their claims
          over the men of color, they accepted the <a>April Decree [1792]</a>. As they
          had anticipated, the men of color, many of whom were slaveholders, had
          only been using the blacks to gain their own political demands.
          Fearing the enfranchisement of the blacks, the men of color deserted
          their comrades in arms, their companions in misfortune, and aligned
          themselves with the whites to subdue them.
        </p>
          <p>
            Treacherously abandoned, the blacks fought for some time against he
            reunited whites and the men of color; but, pressed on all sides,
            losing hope, they accepted the offers of the Spanish king, who,
            having at that time declared war on France, <a>offered freedom to those
            blacks</a> of St. Domingue who would join his armies. Indeed, the
            silence of pre-Republican France on the longstanding claims for
            their natural rights made by the most interested, the noblest, the
            most useful portion of the population of <a>St. Domingue</a> ...
            extinguished all glimmer of hope in the hears of the black slaves
            and forced them, in spite of themselves, to throw themselves into
            the arms of a protective power that offered the only benefit for
            which they would fight. More unfortunate than guilty, they turned
            their arms against their fatherland….
