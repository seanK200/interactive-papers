          It needs to be further observed, however, that if the outer skin of the negro is transparent, the color becomes pronounced in the under-skin, which is reddish-brown, bordering on the dark. But since the skin of the black, like that of the white, is made up of veins, it must necessarily contain some juice. The results of the examination of this juice are at present in question. However, one can say with some basis that the juice is analogous to the bile, an opinion supported by observation, (1) On the cadavers of the Negroes whom I had the opportunity to dissect in Cayenne,1 the bile is always as dark as ink; and (2) it is always more or less black in proportion to the skin color of the negro; (3) the blood is blackish-red, again according to the grade of blackness of the negro’s skin; (4) it is certain that the bile re-enters the chyle in the blood, and flows with it through all parts of the body…<br>
          <br>
          The vessels of the mucous body, following the observations of Malpighi: the skin and the cuticle of the negroes are white; the blackness comes only from the mucous or the reticular membrane which is between the epidermis and the skin. Ruysch’s injections have partly confirmed this discovery, and brought them to light. The outer skin of the negro is not white, according to this anatomy, because it has the whiteness of a [animal’s] horn (blancheur de la corne), which is always has a mixture of black. Ruysch sent to Heifter a portion of the skin of a negro. It was white, certainly, but the external surface of the epidermis was black-tainted, the inside face was covered as well with deep, black taint. Santorini, in his Remarques anatomiques, reports of observations that establish the cause of the color of the Negroes in the mucous membrane. These researches prove that, if the Negro's epidermis was lifted, there remains an extremely black colored portion of the mucous membrane, on the skin or the vascular tissues. This black portion of the mucous membrane is what leaves black stain on the fingers that lifted the epidermis. There is, as a result, a particular reservoir of this black taint between the epidermis and the skin. <br>
          <br>
          The mucous membrane, a tissue almost unknown, appears to be quite unequally distributed in different parts of the body. It is closely attached to the epidermis, and could not be entirely separated from it, and that is why the black color cannot be erased off of the outer skin, and is of a deeper texture in the teguments of the inner surface. The vessels of the reticular membrane are full of blackish liquor (liqueur noirâtre). One may ask where this comes from. Santorini did not believe that one can decide on the source of this material which taints the reticular membrane of the negroes; but he suspected that the liver could furnish the taint of the skin in this human species. The red color of the fish's liver, various sorts of jaundice to which humans are subject, and the blackishness that one finds in the bile vesicles, led him to this conjecture.
