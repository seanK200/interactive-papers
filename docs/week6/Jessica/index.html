            That every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not
            according to the usages of modern Europe, seems to be a fundamental
            maxim with many of our critics and philosophers. Their remarks often
            put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion. If Negroes and
            Indians were disposed to recriminate; if a
            <a>Lucian or a Voltaire from the coast of Guinea</a>, or from the
            Five Nations, were to pay us a visit, what a picture of European
            manners he would present to his countrymen at his return! Nor would
            caricature, or exaggeration be necessary to render it hideous. A
            plain historical account of some of our most fashionable duellists,
            gamblers, and adulterers (to name no more) would exhibit specimens
            of <a>brute barbarity</a>, and sottish infatuation such as might vie
            with any that ever appeared in Kamschatka, California, or the land
            of the Hottentots.

            It is easy to see with what views some modern authors throw out
            these hints to prove the natural inferiority of the Negroes. But let
            every <a>friend of humanity</a> pray, that they may be disappointed.
            <a>Britons are famous for generosity</a>, a virtue in which it is
            easy for them to excel both the Romans and Greeks. Let it never be
            said, that slavery is countenanced by the bravest, and most generous
            people on earth; by a people who are animated with that heroic
            passion, the love of liberty, beyond all nations ancient or modern;
            and the fame of whose toilsome, but unwearied perseverance, in
            vindicating, at the expense of life and fortune,
            <a
              >the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror into the hearts
              of sycophants and tyrants</a
            >, and excite the admiration and gratitude of all good men to the
            latest posterity.

            Editor's note: It seems that Hume responded to some of Beattie's
            criticisms by making some alterations to the text of "Of National
            Characters," in a
            <a
              href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709889?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents"
              >1776 revision</a
            >
            of his work, which was published posthumously in 1777. Below, a
            short passage from the 1754 text is followed by the corresponding
            passage from the 1776 one.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other species
              of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be
              naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized
              nation of any other complexion than white . . .
            </p>

            <p>
              I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the
              whites. <a>There scarcely ever</a> was a civilized nation of that
              complexion, nor even of individual eminent in action or
              speculationâ€¦
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>All else in the essay remained unchanged.</p>

          <b>(M)(Q)</b> How would you find such a person? The author tries to
          paint Africans and Europeans as equal, but he is only able to do so by
          imagining there are Africans like Europeans. The Europeans are still
          the only standard.

          <b>(SU)</b> Beattie, unlike other philosophers, acknowledges the
          barbaric treatment and depictions of Africans and refutes these
          depictions

        <div class="footnotes" id="friend of humanity">
          <b>(ST)</b> The description of 'friend of humanity' suggests that
          those who do not agree with the author's views are not a friend of
          humanity. thus, a. humanity would include both black people and white

          <b>(ST)(A)</b> Although this piece was in response to Hume, Beattie
          uses comparisons and intense diction to counterfeit Hume's claim.

        <div class="footnotes" id="There scarcely ever">
          <b>(SU)</b> It is surprising that Hume adjusted his view, maybe as the
          commonly accepted view of racial inferiority wasn't as widely accepted
          between scholars as it was a few decades later.
