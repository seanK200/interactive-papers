                    <p><b>(BR3 Byunghee)</b> Conscription began on 2 July, and riots began just two days later, in Khojent. They spread rapidly, and Turkestan had to be placed on martial law on 17 July. In August, disorder erupted in Syr Daria, where detachments of rebels thousands strong attacked the major Russian rail lines. By September, the whole steppe was consumed. Rebel violence, which had originally been targeted at local elites, and then at imperial officials and institutions, was now increasingly directed at Russian settlers. The homesteads of 9,000 Russian families were destroyed, and more than 3,500 colonists died. An openly anti-colonial civil war was under way. The Russians drafted 110,000 Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, but tens of thousands of these men died, fled, or were incapacitated. Semirechie alone lost 20 percent of its population and 50 percent of its livestock (see Fig. 9).<a>[16]</a></p>

                    <p><b>(BR3 Byunghee)</b> As 1917 dawned, then, the empire was very different from how it had been two and a half years earlier. The western borderlands were under either foreign occupation or the increasingly coercive military regime. Nationalists were quietly gaining influence as the failing state created an ever larger political vacuum. In the Middle East, <a data-ip-footnote-id="(ARG1-Byunghee)">the empire was expanding, but only within the context of ever more evident ethnic war</a> in the region.<a>[17]</a> In Central Asia, rebellion had torn apart local societies and led to vicious colonial reprisals. Still, the Romanov dynasty remained, and (p.101) with it the more than 300 years of personal and institutional authority that organized political life across the entire expanse of the empire. While the monarch remained, so too did imperial control.</p>

                (ARG) Territorial expansion with an absence of a central powerful power could actually be detrimental to the empire, adding on ethnic hostilities as another problem to the already struggling empire.
