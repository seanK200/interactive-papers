  Book 3, chapter 17 [1] After this, Cambyses planned three campaignsâ€” one
  against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and the third
  against the long-lived Ethiopians living in Libya at the Southern Sea. [2]
  After careful deliberation, he resolved to divide his forces, sending his navy
  against the Carthaginians and dividing his land troops, sending some of them
  against the Ammonians. To the Ethiopians he would first send spies, allegedly
  for the sole purpose of bearing gifts for their king, but whose true mission
  was to observe everything they could and to determine whether the so-called
  Table of the Sun really did exist in the land of these Ethiopians.

  Book 3, chapter 18 [1] The Table of the Sun is said to be something like this.
  There is a meadow which lies at the approach to the town filled with boiled
  meat from every kind of four-footed animal. During the night, the current
  magistrates of the town procure the meat and set it in this meadow, and during
  the day anyone who wishes may come there to feast on it. The local
  inhabitants, however, claim that it is the earth itself which gives forth the
  meat on each occasion it appears. Such is the description that is given of the
  Table of the Sun.

  Book 3, chapter 19 [1] Once Cambyses decided to send the spies, he immediately
  sent for the Fish-eaters from Elephantine, who knew the Ethiopian language.
  [2] When his men had set out to go after the Fisheaters, he ordered his navy
  to sail against Carthage.
