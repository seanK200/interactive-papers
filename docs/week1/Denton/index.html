<h3>Guide to Interpreting Sources</h3><br>
<br>
From Richard Lim and David Kammerling Smith, ed. from “Guide to Interpreting Sources,” The West in the Wider World: Sources and Perspectives, vol. 2 (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003), xxi-xxx.<br>
<br>
<h4>WHY READ THEM</h4><br>
<br>
Primary sources are those sources that have come down to use from an earlier period, often created by participants in or observers of the events they describe or for which they provide evidence. For example, a diary, a law, or a newspaper article speaks to the outlook of the author as well as to the historical context in which it was produced. A primary source also might come from a period after the events it describes and may draw on or excerpt earlier sources that may or may not still exist. Even though documentary—that is, written—sources are important as primary sources, everything is grist for the historian’s mill. Tools, furniture, weapons, artwork, costumes, and architecture represent nonwritten sources that can be as important as the written word for our understanding of human society in the past. <br>
<br>
Sometimes a historian picks and chooses among a wealth of primary sources, focusing on those that seem to relate best to the questions being asked. At other times a historian, especially a scholar of a remote past from which limited sources survive, has to draw on everything that comes to hand. In either case, the historian pieces together a picture from partial and disjointed evidence. The analogy of putting a jigsaw puzzle is not too far off the mark, but the historian most likely does not have all the pieces needed to create a “whole picture.” Knowing how to fill in the gaps is where historical judgment and insight come into play [ . . . ]<br>
<br>
[P]rimary sources . . . are direct evidence of their time. By studying primary sources, you can sharpen your own thinking and reach historical conclusions with confidence. Such interpretation involves asking and answering questions, as discussed on the next page. Mastering the questions to ask of the sources will give you the intellectual training you need to become a good historian. These skills will serve you well both in school and throughout your life. Today we live in a world pervaded by the mass media and have easy access, through the Internet and other means, to more information than we can readily process and evaluate. Learning how to read historical sources will help you become a discriminating consumer of information.<br>
<br>
<h4>HOW TO READ THEM</h4><br>
<br>
A few questions should guide your interpretation of almost any source. Here we rehearse some of these guidelines and then interpret a sample primary source to illustrate how you might follow them. When you first come to a primary source . . . you should first ask the following questions. <br>
<br>
<h1>-Author (AUTH)</h1>><br><br>
Who was the author, and when did he or she write? <br>
<br>
Several issues might be significant to the author’s purpose and prejudices. Was the author male or female? What was his or her economic or social status? Did the author have a professional or employment status that might be significant? For example, if the author was a male government minister, would his official and political position have significantly affected his public comments about the conduct of an ongoing war? What else might have affected the author’s understanding or ability to observe the issues or events described?<br>
<br>
<h1>— Nature of the Source (NAT)</h1> <br>
<br>
If you are examining a written source, what is the type of writing, and how does the specific genre affect the presentation? <br>
<br>
Is it part of a history, a chronicle, or some other self-consciously historical work? Is it a letter or part of a diary? Is it part of an official document?<br>
<br>
<h1>— (Intended) Audience (AUD)  </h1> <br>
<br>
What can we know about the author’s intended audience?<br>
<br>
The form or genre of the source often reveals who the intended audience was. For example, a political treatise written in Latin was intended for an educated male audience, while popular songs in the vernacular were calculated to reach people from all levels of income and literacy. Sometimes the author even names the intended audience or makes comments that only a certain audience could be counted on to understand. The intended audience often affects the author’s style and his or her specific arguments. For example, an author arguing in favor of establishing colonies might shape his argument differently if preparing his text for merchants than he would if preparing his text for government administrators. <br>
<br>
Main Points   What are the major points that the author is trying to convey? These points include both specific arguments and the justifications for those arguments. The justifications for the argument might be as important as the author’s ultimate conclusions. For example, many authors might argue that foreigners should not be admitted into a nation, but their stated justifications might invoke reasons based on economic, cultural, and ethnic or racial factors. <br>
<br>
(Narrow) Interpretation   What can answers to these questions tell us about the author’s point of view, approach, attitude, biases? Is the author trying to promote a certain idea or image? What can the source not tell us and why?<br>
<br>
(Broad) Interpretation What is the historical value of the source, and how does it contribute to our understanding of the particular author, society, and period in question? How might you compare this source with other sources? Does it challenge or reinforce the perspectives offered by those other sources? What can comparing the sources tell us about the historical issue or society in question? <br>
<br>
<h4>VISUAL SOURCES</h4><br>
<br>
A good historian tries to make use of every source of information at his or her disposal. While written primary sources form an important part of historical evidence, a variety of nonwritten sources provide invaluable information and perspectives. Nonwritten sources come in a variety of forms, including pictorial representations, material objects, and archaeological evidence. [ . . . ] The proper evaluation of a nonwritten source follows some of the basic guidelines that apply when you read a written source document. For a visual source, you should ask yourself the following questions.<br>
<br>
Artist/Patron (AUT)  Who was the artist or creator the image? If this is not known, what can we know about the person who commissioned the image to be made or about the context in which the image appeared? For example, did the commissioner of a woodcut print stand to gain financially or politically from the widespread circulation of the image and its underlying message?  <br>
<br>
Nature of the Image (NAT)  What is the type of image, and how does the specific artistic form affect the presentation? For example, a formal portrait, designed to appear in a structured environment that allows careful viewing, permits artistic detail and nuance, whereas a wall poster, designed to appear in any context and likely to be viewed fleetingly, requires blunt images and messages.<br>
<br>
(Intended) Viewers (AUD)  Was the source meant originally for private viewing or for public consumption? What was the nature of its intended audience? Did it circulate beyond its intended audience, and what can we know about how it was appreciated or used? For example, we might distinguish between a political message conveyed in an unpublished private letter and one that was articulated in the columns of a printed newspaper.<br>
<br>
Message of the Image   What are the major points that the artist/patron is trying to convey by means of this particular representation? These often may be understood by comparing the internal components of the painting or by comparing the components of the painting with general social norms and values of the time.  <br>
<br>
(Narrow) Interpretation   What can answers to the above questions tell us about the point of view, approach, biases, and attitude of the creator of the image?  <br>
<br>
(Broad) Interpretation What is the historical value of the source, and how does it contribute to our understanding of a particular individual, group, or society? What does comparison with other sources tell us about the historical theme in question?<br>
<br>
<h3>How to Read a Primary Source</h3><br>
<br>
Zachary Schrag’s Guidelines for History Students, from https://historyprofessor.org/research/how-to-read-a-primary-source/    <br>
<br>
One of the key skills history students must learn is how to use primary sources. A primary source can be a document, artwork, artifact, or oral-history interview, just so long as it tells us something about the past and is as close as we can get to the past. Primary sources are those sources created by people who participated in an event, witnessed it firsthand, or at least heard about it from a credible witness.<br>
<br>
Why read primary sources? Why read the letters of a Civil War soldier instead of just reading a recent book about the war? One answer is that no book is ever complete. A historian may offer a compelling interpretation of an event, but there is always more to learn. Another answer is that reading primary sources is training for other forms of critical inquiry. If more people had demanded the internal documents produced at Enron in the late 1990s, instead of just the executives’ misleading statements about what was going on, millions of consumers, investors, taxpayers and workers would be better off today.<br>
<br>
Historians ask all manner of questions about primary sources. Here I have tried to group such questions into six larger categories, to suggest a means by which to approach an unfamiliar source. Keep in mind that answering these questions in order will not create an essay, but it may well produce a good set of notes for an essay.<br>
<br>
<h1>— Question (Q)</h1><br>
<br>
What is the question?<br>
<br>
Let us postulate that every primary source is created to fill a specific need. The first task of the historian is to determine that need. What question was the author trying to answer; what problem was she trying to solve? Sometimes the author will tell you explicitly. Drafting the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson explained that "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires" that the American people explain why they are declaring independence. Any advertisement is likely designed to persuade someone to buy a product or service. In other cases, the historian may need to make educated guesses. When an immigrant wrote home to his family, was he trying to persuade them to come join him, or was he emphasizing the hardship of his new life?<br>
<br>
A source need not be made of words to suggest a question. A landscape painter may be asking, how does a railroad shape the American countryside? A census taker begins with a list of questions–how many people live in the household, what are their occupations, and so on. The historian can then ask, why did the Census Bureau decide those were the important questions, rather than others?<br>
<br>
<h1>— Answer (A)</h1><br>

<br>
What is the answer?<br>
<br>
Just as sources generally present some kind of question, they also present some kind of answer. Again, sometimes the source is explicit. A court decision or law is itself an answer to a question. Is it constitutional to segregate public schools by race? In its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court answered that question. Likewise, whatever problem is posed by an advertisement–sick children, unrequited love, ring around the collar–the suggested answer is always the same: buy our product. In other cases, the author may not have so precise an answer, but may only suggest a way of thought. A portrait, whether a painting or photograph, often suggests how the subject wishes to be perceived. He may not want the viewer to do anything specific, but to think about him in a certain way.<br>
<br>
<h1>— Style (ST)</h1><br>
<br>
What is the style?<br>
<br>
An author who has chosen a question and an answer must still decide how to express herself. Two people may agree that alcohol abuse is a problem and that temperance is the answer. But one may argue by citing the Bible, while the other argues using tables of statistics. The difference may suggest different world views of the two authors. Pay attention to whether the language is formal or informal. Does the author use only reasoned argument, or does she compare her opponents to animals? Is she trying to persuade people who disagree with her, or to rally people who already agree?<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for metaphors, especially those comparing human beings to animals. When your neighbor compares you to vermin, it’s time to move. For images, ask whether the image’s creator wanted to present as realistic a view as possible–showing how the scene actually appeared to her–or whether she was fitting the visual world into an established convention.<br>
<br>
<h1>— Context (C)</h1><br>
<br>
What is the context?<br>
<br>
History is premised, in part, on the notion that any document can tell us something about the time and place in which it was produced, and, conversely, that time and place can help us understand the document. What was going on when the document was created? Was the nation at war or peace? Prosperous or impoverished? Was the author powerful or weak? Look for references to people and events.<br>
<br>
<h1>— Missing (M)</h1><br>
<br>
What is missing?<br>
<br>
Ask what the source is trying to hide, either by not mentioning it at all, passing over it quickly, or obscuring it in a footnote. Does the document contradict itself? Does it contradict something else the author wrote? Does it leave out information that would be important to the reader? Figuring out what the author does not want the reader to know is a good way to understand her true agenda. With images, something is always missing: the part of the scene outside the frame, and behind the painter or camera. What is it?<br>
<br>
<h1>—   Surprising (SU)</h1><br>
<br>
<b>What is surprising?</b><br>
<br>
These first five questions are all designed to lead you to ask the most important and most difficult question: what is surprising? That is, what did you learn from this document that you did not know before? Much of what you read may confirm what you already knew or could have guessed. Slaves opposed slavery. Clergymen promoted church attendance. No one liked paying taxes. All of that is important, but to write a compelling essay you will need to dig deeper, perhaps re-reading the source two or three times before you hit on something that does not fit. Isn’t it odd that veterans of the Revolutionary War later drank toasts to England to express their disgust with Jefferson? Or that Henry David Thoreau wrote a whole book about the Merrimack River that ignored the booming city of Lowell?1 Or that the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency portrayed alpha, beta, and gamma radiation as three sexy women?2<br>
<br>
Figuring out what is surprising does take work. In some cases, careful reading of a single source can reveal surprising contradictions. Alternatively, what is surprising is a break in a pattern established by other primary and secondary sources. It”s like a game of duck-duck-goose; the cry of Goose! is surprising only because of all the ducks that came before it. As you read a source, think hard about whether it is a duck or a goose.<br>
<br>
Once you have found something odd in a primary source, you have a question: why is that oddness there? And once you have a question, you can answer it with a thesis statement.<br>
<br>
