<h1>Herodotus, the Histories</h1>
<p>
  Book 3, chapter 38 [1] I am convinced by all the evidence that Cambyses was
  seriously deranged. Otherwise he would not have endeavored to mock what is
  sacred and customary. For if someone were to assign to every person in the
  world the task of selecting the best of all customs, each one, after thorough
  consideration, would choose those of his own people, so strongly do humans
  believe that their own customs are the best ones.

  Book 3, chapter 114 [1] In the region where the sun sets at the end of day
  lies Ethiopian territory, at the southwest edge of the inhabited world. This
  land produces much gold, enormous elephants, all kinds of wild trees, ebony,
  and men who are most tall, handsome, and long-lived.
