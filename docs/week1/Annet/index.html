  Herodotus of Halicarnassus, his Researches are here set down to preserve the
  memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements both of
  our own and of other peoples; and more particularly, to show how they came
  into conflict. (SÃ©lincourt translation)

  Herodotus of Halicarnassus here presents his research so that human events do
  not fade with time. May the great and wonderful deeds - some brought forth by
  the Hellenes, others by the barbarians - not go unsung; as well as the causes
  that led them to make war on each other. (Strassler translation, The Landmark
  Herodotus )
