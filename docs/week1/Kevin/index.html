  Book 2, chapter 29 [1] But I could learn nothing from anyone else. However, I
  did learn as much as I could be traveling to the city of Elephantine [modern
  Aswan] and seeing it for myself, but I investigated the region beyond that
  point through hearsay alone. [2] From Elephantine, as one travels inland, the
  ground rises steeply, and so here one must bind one's boat securely on either
  side, as though it were an ox, in order to advance. If the rope should break,
  the boat is instantly gone, carried away by the force of the current. [3] The
  voyage to this place takes four days, and here the Nile winds and curves like
  the Maeander. There are eighty miles one must sail through by this method. But
  then you reach a level plain, where the Nile flows around an island called
  Tachompso. [4] Half of this island is inhabited by Ethiopians from
  Elephantine, the other half by Egyptians. Adjacent to the island is a huge
  lake, whose surrounding land is used for pasture by Ethiopian nomads. If you
  sail through here, you will come to the channel of the Nile that slows into
  this lake. [5] Then, disembarking beside the river, you make a forty-day
  journey by foot. For there are many reefs just below the surface as well as
  sharp rocks jutting out of the Nile through which one cannot sail. [6] But
  after traveling through this land for forty days, you can embark on a boat
  again and then sail for twelve days until you arrive at a large city by the
  name of Meroe. [7] It is said that this city is the metropolis of the
  Ethiopians. Here the only gods the people worship are Zeus and Dionysos, and
  they give great honor to them. They have established an oracle of Zeus, and
  they make war whenever the god tells them to do so via his divine utterances,
  and they march wherever he orders them to go.

  Book 2, chapter 104 [1] And it
  is indeed obvious that the Colchians are really Egyptians. I say this because
  I noticed this resemblance myself and then I heard about it from others, too.
  As I considered the matter, I questioned both peoples and it turned out that
  they did remember each other, although the Colchians remembered the Egyptians
  more than the Egyptians the Colchians. [2] The Egyptians stated that they
  believed the Colchians were from the army of Sesostris. I myself had also
  guessed that; first, because they are black-skinned and wooly-haired (although
  this in itself proves nothing, since others are like this, too), but even more
  because, of all peoples, only the Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians
  have practiced circumcision from earliest times.

  Book 3, chapter 17 [1] After this, Cambyses planned three campaignsâ€” one
  against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and the third
  against the long-lived Ethiopians living in Libya at the Southern Sea. [2]
  After careful deliberation, he resolved to divide his forces, sending his navy
  against the Carthaginians and dividing his land troops, sending some of them
  against the Ammonians. To the Ethiopians he would first send spies, allegedly
  for the sole purpose of bearing gifts for their king, but whose true mission
  was to observe everything they could and to determine whether the so-called
  Table of the Sun really did exist in the land of these Ethiopians.
