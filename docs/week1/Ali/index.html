  Book 3, chapter 21 [1] When the Fish-eaters arrived in Ethiopia, they
  presented the gifts to the king with these words: “Cambyses King of the
  Persians wishes to become your friend and ally and has sent us here with
  orders to talk with you and present to you these gifts, which are the things
  he himself enjoys most.” [2] The Ethiopian, realizing that they had come as
  spies, replied, “You are not telling the truth: the King of Persia did not
  send you here bearing gifts because he puts great value on becoming my ally.
  You have really come to spy on my kingdom, and he must be an unjust man. If he
  were just, he would not have set his heart on a country other than his own,
  nor would he be trying to force people who have not harmed him at all into
  slavery. But in any case, give him this bow and repeat to him these words: [3]
  ‘The king of the Ethiopians offers this advice to the king of the Persians.
  Whenever Persians can draw a bow as large as this one as effortlessly as I
  can, then do make war on the long-lived Ethiopians with your superior numbers.
  But until then, thank the gods for not directing the minds of the sons of
  Ethiopians toward the acquisition of land other than their own.”’

  Book 3, chapter 22 [1] After saying this, he released the bow and gave it to
  the men who had come to him. Then, picking up the purple cloak, he asked what
  it was and how it had been made. The Fish-eaters told him the truth,
  explaining the purple dye and the dyeing process, and he responded by saying
  that these people were deceitful and so were their cloaks. [2] Next, he asked
  about the gold, the twisted necklace, and the bracelets. As the Fisheaters
  described these items as jewelry, the king burst out laughing. He had thought
  they were shackles, and he told them that among his people, shackles were
  stronger than these. [3] Third, he asked about the perfume. When they had
  reported to him how it was manufactured and used for anointment, he gave the
  same comment he had given about the cloak. But when he came to the wine and
  learned how it was made, he found great delight in the drink and asked what
  the king ate and what was the longest life span of a Persian man. [4] They
  said he ate bread, related how wheat was grown, and set eighty years as the
  longest life span for a man. To this the Ethiopian replied that it was no
  wonder they survived only a few years if they subsisted on manure, and they
  would not even be able to live that long if they did not restore themselves
  with the drink; and as he made this remark to the Fish-eaters, he pointed to
  the wine, for at least in this one respect he admitted that his own people
  were inferior to the Persians
