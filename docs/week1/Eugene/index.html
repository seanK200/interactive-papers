  Book 3, chapter 23 [1] The Fish-eaters in turn then asked the king about the
  life span and diet in his country, and he told them that most of his people
  lived to the age of 120 years, and some even surpassed this age. Their food,
  he said, was boiled meat, and their drink was milk. [2] When the spies
  expressed amazement at this life span, he led them to a spring in which they
  bathed and became smoother and sleeker, just as though it consisted of olive
  oil and it smelled as thou it consisted of violets. [3] The spies said that
  the liquid of this spring was so light that there was nothing that could float
  on top of it, neither wood nor anything lighter than wood; indeed, everything
  sank down to its depths. This liquid, if it truly is anything like it is
  described, would be the chief reason that the people who use it are so long
  lived. [4] Leaving the spring, he led them to the menâ€™s prison, where the
  prisoners were all bound in shackles made of gold, for to these Ethiopians,
  the rarest and most highly valued metal of all is copper. After observing the
  prison, the spies also viewed the so-called Table of the Sun.

  Book 3, chapter 24 [1] Last of all, they saw the Ethiopian coffins, which are
  said to be made of crystal in the following way. [2] When they have dried the
  corpse, whether according to the Egyptian method or otherwise, they plaster
  the whole body with gypsum, then decorate it with paint to resemble the
  appearance of the person as closely as possible. Next they enclose it in a
  hollow column of crystal, which they excavate in great quantities and which is
  easy to work. [3] The painted corpse is visible from where it is placed in the
  middle of the column, and while it has every appearance of being the natural
  body itself it gives off no unpleasant odor or any other unseemly effect. [4]
  The closest relatives of the deceased keep the column in their home for one
  year, offering it a portion of everything as first fruits and sacrificing to
  it. After one year, the columns are carried out and set up around the city.
