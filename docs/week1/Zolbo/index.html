<h1>Herodotus, <i>The Histories</i></h1>

<p>
  <b>Book 3, chapter 18</b>
  [1] The Table of the Sun is said to be something like this. There is a meadow
  which lies at the approach to the town filled with boiled meat from every kind
  of four-footed animal. During the night, the current magistrates of the town
  procure the meat and set it in this meadow, and during the day anyone who
  wishes may come there to feast on it. The local inhabitants, however, claim
  that it is the earth itself which gives forth the meat on each occasion it
  appears. Such is the description that is given of the Table of the Sun.

  <b>Book 3, chapter 19</b> [1] Once Cambyses decided to send the spies, he
  immediately sent for the Fish-eaters from Elephantine, who knew the Ethiopian
  language. [2] When his men had set out to go after the Fisheaters, he ordered
  his navy to sail against Carthage.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Book 3, chapter 20</b> [1] After the Fish-eaters had come from Elephantine
  and met with Cambyses, he sent them to the Ethiopians with instructions about
  what they should say, and he gave them gifts to take there: a purple cloak, a
  necklace of twisted gold, bracelets, an alabaster pot of perfume, and a jar of
  Phoenician date-palm wine. The Ethiopians to whom Cambyses sent these gifts
  are reputed to be the tallest and most beautiful of all peoples. [2] It is
  also said that their laws and customs are different and completely unlike
  those of anyone else, particularly in respect to their kingship, for they
  select the tallest of their men who possesses strength to match his size to
  reign as their king.
