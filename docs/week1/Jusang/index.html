  Book 3, chapter 22 [1] After saying this, he released the bow and gave it to
  the men who had come to him. Then, picking up the purple cloak, he asked what
  it was and how it had been made. The Fish-eaters told him the truth,
  explaining the purple dye and the dyeing process, and he responded by saying
  that these people were deceitful and so were their cloaks. [2] Next, he asked
  about the gold, the twisted necklace, and the bracelets. As the Fisheaters
  described these items as jewelry, the king burst out laughing. He had thought
  they were shackles, and he told them that among his people, shackles were
  stronger than these. [3] Third, he asked about the perfume. When they had
  reported to him how it was manufactured and used for anointment, he gave the
  same comment he had given about the cloak. But when he came to the wine and
  learned how it was made, he found great delight in the drink and asked what
  the king ate and what was the longest life span of a Persian man. [4] They
  said he ate bread, related how wheat was grown, and set eighty years as the
  longest life span for a man. To this the Ethiopian replied that it was no
  wonder they survived only a few years if they subsisted on manure, and they
  would not even be able to live that long if they did not restore themselves
  with the drink; and as he made this remark to the Fish-eaters, he pointed to
  the wine, for at least in this one respect he admitted that his own people
  were inferior to the Persians

  Book 3, chapter 23 [1] The Fish-eaters in turn then asked the king about the
  life span and diet in his country, and he told them that most of his people
  lived to the age of 120 years, and some even surpassed this age. Their food,
  he said, was boiled meat, and their drink was milk. [2] When the spies
  expressed amazement at this life span, he led them to a spring in which they
  bathed and became smoother and sleeker, just as though it consisted of olive
  oil and it smelled as though it consisted of violets. [3] The spies said that
  the liquid of this spring was so light that there was nothing that could float
  on top of it, neither wood nor anything lighter than wood; indeed, everything
  sank down to its depths. This liquid, if it truly is anything like it is
  described, would be the chief reason that the people who use it are so long
  lived. [4] Leaving the spring, he led them to the menâ€™s prison, where the
  prisoners were all bound in shackles made of gold, for to these Ethiopians,
  the rarest and most highly valued metal of all is copper. After observing the
  prison, the spies also viewed the so-called Table of the Sun.
