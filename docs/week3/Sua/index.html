          <h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
          <p>
            From Marrákush I travelled with the suite of our master [the Sultan]
            to Fez, where I took leave of our master and set out for the
            Negrolands. I reached the town of Sijilmása, a very fine town, with
            quantities of excellent dates.[1] The city of Basra rivals it in
            abundance of dates, but the Sijilmása dates are better, and the kind
            called Irár has no equal in the world. I stayed there with the
            learned Abti Muhammad al-Bushrí, the man whose brother I met in the
            city of Qanjanfú in China. How strangely separated they are! He
            showed me the utmost honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Sijilmása I bought camels and a four months’ supply of forage for
            them. Thereupon I set out on the 1st Muharram of the year [seven
            hundred and] fifty-three [18th February 1352] with a caravan
            including, amongst others, a number of the merchants of Sijilmása.
            After twenty-five days we reached Tagházá,
            <a>an unattractive village</a>, with the curious feature that its
            houses and mosques are built of blocks of salt, roofed with camel
            skins. There are no trees there, nothing but sand. In the sand is a
            salt mine; they dig for the salt, and find it in thick slabs, lying
            one on top of the other, as though they had been tool-squared and
            laid under the surface of the earth.[2] A camel will carry two of
            these slabs. No one lives at Tagházá except the slaves of the
            Massúfa tribe, who dig for the salt; they subsist on dates imported
            from Dar‘a[3] and Sijilmása, camels’ flesh, and millet imported from
            the Negrolands. The negroes come up from their country and take away
            the salt from there. [page 317]
          </p>
          <p>
            At Iwálátan a load of salt brings eight to ten mithqáls; in the town
            of Mállí it sells for twenty to thirty, and sometimes as much as
            forty. The negroes use salt as a medium of exchange, just as gold
            and silver is used [elsewhere]; they cut it up into pieces and buy
            and sell with it. The business done at Tagházá, for all its
            meanness, amounts to an enormous figure in terms of hundredweights
            of gold-dust.[4]
