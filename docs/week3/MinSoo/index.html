            Book 3, chapter 17 [1] After this, Cambyses planned three campaignsâ€”
            one against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians, and
            the third against the long-lived Ethiopians living in Libya at the
            Southern Sea. [2] After careful deliberation, he resolved to divide
            his forces, sending his navy against the Carthaginians and dividing
            his land troops, sending some of them against the Ammonians. To the
            Ethiopians he would first send spies, allegedly for the sole purpose
            of bearing gifts for their king, but whose true mission was to
            observe everything they could and to determine whether the so-called
            <a>Table of the Sun</a> really did exist in the land of these
            Ethiopians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book 3, chapter 18 [1] The Table of the Sun is said to be something
            like this. There is a meadow which lies at the approach to the town
            filled with boiled meat from every kind of four-footed animal.
            During the night, the current magistrates of the town procure the
            meat and set it in this meadow, and during the day anyone who wishes
            may come there to feast on it. The local inhabitants, however, claim
            that it is the earth itself which gives forth the meat on each
            occasion it appears. Such is the description that is given of the
            Table of the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book 3, chapter 19 [1] Once Cambyses decided to send the spies, he
            immediately sent for the Fish-eaters from Elephantine, who knew the
            Ethiopian language. [2] When his men had set out to go after the
            Fisheaters, he ordered his navy to sail against Carthage.

          <b>(C)</b> probably viewed as important by the persians because it
          seems to have been viewed as the source of power for the eitiopians,
          and thus something to steal/destroy so that he could put them under
          submission. Not entirely a new idea for rulers of the
          mesopotamia/Persia. Been happening since biblical times.
