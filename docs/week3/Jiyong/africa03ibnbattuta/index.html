            Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325-1354

          , trans. by H.A.R. Gibb (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd, 1929), available at archive.org,

          <blockquote>
            Ibn Battuta started on his travels in 1325, when he was 20 years old. His main reason to travel was to go on
            a
            <i>
              Hajj
            </i>
            , or a Pilgrimage to Mecca, <a data-ip-footnote-id="101">to fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam</a>. But his
            traveling went on for around 29 years and he covered about
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[56]">
              75,000 miles visiting the equivalent of 44 modern countries
            </a>
            which were then mostly under the governments of Muslim leaders of
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="102">the World of Islam</a>, or
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[55]">
              "Dar al-Islam."
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            He met many dangers and had numerous adventures along the way. He was attacked by bandits, almost drowned in
            a sinking ship, and nearly beheaded by a tyrant ruler. He also had a few marriages and lovers and fathered
            several children on his travels.
            <br />
            <br />
            Near the end of Ibn Battuta's life, the Sultan of Morocco insisted that Ibn Battuta dictate the
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="103">story of his travels to a scholar</a> and today we can read translations of
            that account, which was originally titled
            <i>
              Tuhfat al-anzar fi gharaaib al-amsar wa ajaaib al-asfar
            </i>
            , or
            <i>
              A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling
            </i>
            .
            <br />
            <br />
            That title is a bit of a mouthful so the text is generally just called Ibn Battuta's
            <i>
              Rihla
            </i>
            , or
            <i>
              Journey
            </i>

          From
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[59]">
            Marrákush
          </a>
          I travelled with the suite of our master [the Sultan] to
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[60]">
            Fez
          </a>
          , where I took leave of our master and set out for the <a data-ip-footnote-id="104">Negrolands</a>. I reached
          the town of Sijilmása, a very fine town, with quantities of excellent dates.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]">
            [1]
          </a>
          The city of Basra rivals it in abundance of dates, but the Sijilmása dates are better, and the kind called
          Irár has no equal in the world. I stayed there with the learned Abti Muhammad al-Bushrí, the man whose brother
          I <a data-ip-footnote-id="105">met</a> in the city of Qanjanfú in China. How strangely separated they are! He
          showed me the utmost honour.
          <br />
          <br />
          At
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[61]">
            Sijilmása
          </a>
          I bought camels and a four months’ supply of forage for them. Thereupon I set out on the 1st Muharram of the
          year [seven hundred and] fifty-three [18th February 1352] with a caravan including, amongst others, a number
          of the merchants of Sijilmása. After twenty-five days we reached
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[62]">
            Tagházá
          </a>
          , <a data-ip-footnote-id="106">an unattractive village</a>, with the curious feature that its houses and
          mosques are built of blocks of <a data-ip-footnote-id="107">salt</a>, roofed with camel skins. There are no
          trees there, nothing but sand. In the sand is a salt mine; they dig for the salt, and find it in thick slabs,
          lying one on top of the other, as though they had been tool-squared and laid under the surface of the earth.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]">
            [2]
          </a>
          A camel will carry two of these slabs. No one lives at Tagházá except the slaves of the Massúfa tribe, who dig
          for the salt; they subsist on dates imported from Dar‘a
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[3]">
            [3]
          </a>
          and Sijilmása, camels’ flesh, and millet imported from the Negrolands. The negroes come up from their country
          and take away the salt from there. [page 317]
          <br />
          <br />
          At
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          a load of <a data-ip-footnote-id="108">salt brings</a> eight to ten <a data-ip-footnote-id="109">mithqáls</a>;
          in the town of Mállí it sells for twenty to thirty, and sometimes as much as forty. The negroes use
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="110">salt</a> as a <a data-ip-footnote-id="111">medium of exchange</a>, just as gold
          and silver is used [elsewhere]; they cut it up into pieces and buy and sell with it. The business done at
          Tagházá, for all its meanness, amounts to an enormous figure in terms of hundredweights of
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="112">gold-dust.</a>
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[4]">
            [4]
          </a>
          <br />
          <br />
          We passed ten days of discomfort there, because the water is brackish and the place is plagued with flies.
          Water supplies are laid in at Tagházá for the crossing of the desert which lies beyond it, which is a
          ten-nights’ journey with no water on the way except on rare occasions. We indeed had the good fortune to find
          water in plenty, in pools left by the rain. One day we found a pool of sweet water between two rocky
          prominences. We quenched our thirst at it and then washed our clothes. Truffles are plentiful in this desert
          and it swarms with lice, so that people wear string necklaces containing mercury,
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="113">which kills them</a>. At that time we used to go ahead of the caravan, and when
          we found a place suitable for pasturage we would graze our beasts. We went on doing this until one of our
          party was lost in the desert; after that I neither went ahead nor lagged behind. We passed a caravan on the
          way and they told us that some of their party had become separated from them. We found one of them dead under
          a shrub, of the sort that grows in the sand, with his clothes on and a whip in his hand. The water was only
          about a mile away from him.
          <br />
          <br />
          We came next to
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[63]">
            Tásarahlá
          </a>
          , a place of subterranean water-beds, where the caravans halt.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[5]">
            [5]
          </a>
          They stay there three days to rest, mend their waterskins, fill them with water, and sew on them covers of
          sack- cloth as a precaution against the wind. From this point the takshíf is despatched. The takshíf is a name
          [page 318] given to any man of the Massúfa tribe who is hired by the persons in the caravan to go ahead to
          Iwálátan, carrying letters from them to their friends there, so that they may take lodgings for them. These
          persons then come out a distance of four nights' journey to meet the caravan, and bring water with them.
          Anyone who has no friend in Iwálátan writes to some merchant well known for his worthy character, who then
          undertakes the same services for him. It often happens that the takshíf perishes in this desert, with the
          result that the people of Iwálátan know nothing about the caravan, and all or most of those who are with it
          perish. That desert is haunted by demons; if the takshíf be alone,
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="114">they make sport of him and disorder his mind</a>, so that he loses his way and
          perishes. For there is no visible road or track in these parts— nothing but sand blown hither and thither by
          the wind. You see hills of sand in one place, and afterwards you will see them moved to quite another place.
          The guide there is one who has made the journey frequently in both directions, and who is gifted with a quick
          intelligence. I remarked, as a strange thing, that the guide whom we had was blind in one eye, and diseased in
          the other, yet he had the best knowledge of the road of any man. We hired the takshíf on this journey for a
          hundred gold mithqáls; he was a man of the Massúfa. On the night of the seventh day [from Tásarahlá] we saw
          with joy the fires of the party who had come out to meet us.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[52]">
            [Ross Dunn’s commentary, part 3]
          </a>
          <br />
          <br />
          Thus we reached the town of
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          [Walata] after a journey from Sijilmása of two months to a day.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[6]">
            [6]
          </a>
          Iwálátan is the northernmost province of the negroes, and the sultan’s representative there was one Farbá
          Husayn, farbá meaning deputy [in their language]. When we arrived there, the merchants deposited their goods
          in an open square, where the blacks undertook to guard them, and went to the [page 319] farbá. He was sitting
          on a carpet under an archway, with his guards before him carrying lances and bows in their hands, and the
          headmen of the Massúfa behind him. The merchants remained standing in front of him while he spoke to them
          through an interpreter, although they were close to him, to show his contempt for them.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="115"
            >It was then that I repented of having come to their country, because of their lack of manners and their
            contempt for the whites.</a
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          I went to visit Ibn Baddá, a worthy man of Salá [Sallee, Rabát], to whom I had written requesting him to hire
          a house for me, and who had done so. Later on the mushríf [inspector] of
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          , whose name was Manshá Jú, invited all those who had come with the caravan to partake of his hospitality. At
          first I refused to attend, but my companions urged me very strongly, so I went with die rest. The repast was
          served — some pounded millet mixed with a little honey and <a data-ip-footnote-id="116">milk</a>, put in a
          half calabash shaped like a large bowl. The guests drank and retired. I said to them
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="117">"Was it for this that the black invited us?”</a> They answered "Yes; and it is in
          their opinion the highest form of hospitality.” This convinced me that there was no good to be hoped for from
          these people, and I made up my mind to travel [back to Morocco at once] with the pilgrim caravan from
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          . Afterwards, however, I thought it best to go to see the capital of their king [at Mállí].
          <br />
          <br />
          My stay at
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          lasted about fifty days; and I was shown honour and entertained by its inhabitants. It is an excessively hot
          place, and boasts a few small date-palms, in the shade of which they sow water-melons. Its water comes from
          underground waterbeds at that point, and there is plenty of mutton to be had. The garments of its inhabitants,
          most of whom belong to the Massúfa tribe, are of fine Egyptian fabrics.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="118">Their women are of surpassing beauty,</a> and [page 320] are shown more respect
          than the men. The state of affairs amongst these people is indeed extraordinary. Their men show no signs of
          jealousy whatever; no one claims descent from his father, but on the contrary from his
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="119">mother's brother</a>. A person’s heirs are his sister's sons, not his own sons.
          This is a thing which I have seen nowhere in the world except among the Indians of Malabar.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="120">But those are heathens</a>; these people are Muslims, punctilious in observing
          the hours of prayer, studying books of law, and memorizing the Koran. Yet their women show no bashfulness
          before men and do not veil themselves, though they are assiduous in attending the prayers. Any man who wishes
          to marry one of them may do so, but they do not travel with their husbands, and even if one desired to do so
          her family would not allow her to go.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="121"
            >The women there have “friends” and “companions” amongst the men outside their own families, and the men in
            the same way have “companions” amongst the women of other families. A man may go into his house and find his
            wife entertaining her “companion” but he takes no objection to it</a
          >.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="122"
            >One day at Iwálátan I went into the qádi’s house, after asking his permission to enter, and found with him
            a young woman of remarkable beauty.</a
          >
          When I saw her I was shocked and turned to go out, but she laughed at me, instead of being overcome by shame,
          and the qádí said to me “Why are you going out? She is my companion.” I was amazed at their conduct, for he
          was a theologian and a pilgrim to boot. I was told that he had asked the sultan's permission to make the
          pilgrimage that year with his “companion” (whether this one or not I cannot say) but the sultan would not
          grant it.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I decided to make the journey to Mállí, which is reached in twenty-four days from
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[64]">
            Iwálátan
          </a>
          if the traveller pushes on rapidly, I hired a guide from [page 321] the Massúfa (for there is no necessity to
          travel in a company on account of the safety of that road), and set out with three of my companions. On the
          way there are many trees, and these trees are of great age and girth; a whole caravan may shelter in the shade
          of one of them. There are trees which have neither branches nor leaves, yet the shade cast by their trunks is
          sufficient to shelter a man. Some of these trees are rotted in the interior and the rain-water collects in
          them, so that they serve as wells and the people drink of the water inside them.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[7]">
            [7]
          </a>
          In others there are bees and honey, which is collected by the people. I was surprised to find
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="123">inside one tree</a>, by which I passed, a man, a weaver, who had set up his loom
          in it and was actually weaving.
          <br />
          <br />
          A traveller in this country carries no provisions, whether plain food or seasonings, and neither gold nor
          silver. He takes nothing but pieces of salt and glass ornaments, which the people call beads, and some
          aromatic goods. When he comes to a village the womenfolk of the blacks bring out millet, milk, chickens,
          pulped lotus fruit, rice, fúni (a grain resembling mustard seed, from which kuskusú
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[8]">
            [8]
          </a>
          and gruel are made), and pounded haricot beans. The traveller buys what of these he wants, but
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="124">their rice causes sickness to whites when it is eaten</a>, and the fúni is
          preferable to it.<a data-ip-footnote-id="125">[comment]</a>

          I saw a crocodile in this part of the Nile, close to the bank; it looked just like a small boat. One day I
          went down to the river to satisfy a need, and lo, one of the blacks came and stood between me and the river. I
          was<a data-ip-footnote-id="129"> amazed at such lack of manners and decency</a> on his part, and spoke of it

          candles and food, and next day Ibn al-Faqíh himself came to visit me, with other prominent residents. I met
          the qádí of Mállí, 'Abd ar-Rahmán, who came to see me; he is a negro, a pilgrim, and a man of fine character.
          I met also the interpreter Dúghá, who is one of the principal men among the blacks.

          All these persons sent me hospitality-gifts of food and treated me with the utmost generosity — may God reward
          them for their kindnesses! Ten days after our arrival we ate a gruel made of a root resembling colocasia,
          which is preferred by them to all other dishes. We all fell ill — there were six of us — and one of our number
          died. I for my part went to the morning prayer and fainted there, l asked a certain Egyptian for a loosening
          remedy and he gave me a thing called baydar, made of vegetable roots, which lie mixed with aniseed and sugar,
          and stirred in water. I drank it off and vomited what I had eaten, together with a large quantity of bile. God
          preserved me from death but I was ill for two months.

          He is a miserly king, not a man from whom one might hope for a rich present. It happened that I spent these
          two months without seeing him, on account of my illness. Later on he held a banquet in commemoration of our
          master [the late sultan of Morocco] Abu’l-Hasan, to which the commanders, doctors, qádí and preacher were
          invited, and I went along with them. Reading-desks were brought in, and the Koran was read through, then they
          prayed for our master Abu’l-Hasan and also for Mansá Sulaymán. When the ceremony was over I went [page 324]
          forward and saluted Mansá Sulaymán. The qádí, the preacher, and Ibn al-Faqíh told him who I was, and he
          answered them in their tongue. They said to me "The sultan says to you ‘Give thanks to God,'” so I said
          “Praise be to God and thanks under all circumstances.”
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[22]">

          </a>
          <br />
          <br />
          When I withdrew the [sultan’s] hospitality gift was sent to me. It was taken first to the qádí's house, and
          the qádí sent it on with his men to Ibn al-Faqíh’s house. Ibn al-Faqíh came hurrying out of his house
          bare-footed, and entered my room saying “Stand up; here comes the sultan's stuff and gift to you.” So I stood
          up thinking [since he had called it “stuff"] that it consisted of robes of honour and money, and lo! it was
          three cakes of bread, and a piece of beef fried in native oil, and a calabash of sour curds. When I saw this I
          burst out laughing, and thought it a most amazing thing that they could be so foolish and make so much of such
          a paltry matter.
          <br />
          <br />
          For two months after this hospitality gift was sent to me I received nothing further from the sultan, and then
          followed the month of Ramadán. Meanwhile I used to go frequently to the palace where I would salute him and
          sit alongside the qádí and the preacher. I had a conversation with Dúghá the interpreter, and he said “Speak
          in his presence, and I shall express on your behalf what is necessary.” When the sultan held an audience early
          in Ramadán, I rose and stood before him and said to him: “I have travelled through the countries of the world
          and have met their kings. Here have I been four months in your country, yet you have neither shown me
          hospitality, nor given me anything. What am I to say of you before [other] rulers?” The sultan replied “I have
          not seen you, and have not been told about you.”
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="132"
            >The qádí and Ibn al-Faqíh rose and replied to him, saying “He has already saluted you, and you [page 325]
            have sent him food.”</a
          >
          Thereupon he gave orders to set apart a house for my lodging and to pay me a daily sum for my expenses. Later
          on, on the night of the 27th Ramadán, he distributed a sum of money which they call the Zakáh [alms] between
          the qádí, the preachers, and the doctors.

          He gave me a portion along with them of thirty-three and a third mithqáls and on my departure from Mállí he
          bestowed on me a gift of a hundred gold mithqáls.

          On certain days the sultan holds audiences in the palace yard, where there is a platform under a tree, with
          three steps; this they call the pempi.

          It is carpeted with silk and has cushions placed on it. [Over it] is raised the umbrella, which is a sort of
          pavilion made of silk, surmounted by a bird in gold, about the size of a falcon. The sultan comes out of a
          door in a corner of the palace, carrying a bow in his hand and a quiver on his back. On his head he has a
          golden skull-cap, bound with a gold band which has narrow ends shaped like knives, more than a span in length.
          His usual dress is a velvety red tunic, made of the European fabrics called mutanfas. The sultan is preceded
          by his musicians, who carry gold and silver guimbris [two-stringed guitars], and behind him come three hundred
          armed slaves. He walks in a leisurely fashion, affecting a very slow movement, and even stops from time to
          time. On reaching the pempi he stops and looks round the assembly, then ascends it in the sedate manner of a
          preacher ascending a mosque-pulpit. As he takes his seat the drums, trumpets, and bugles are sounded. Three
          slaves go out at a run to summon the sovereign’s deputy and the military commanders, who enter and sit down.

          If he summons any of them while he is holding an audience in his pavilion, the person summoned takes off his
          clothes and puts on worn garments, removes his turban and dons a dirty skull-cap, and enters with his garments
          and trousers raised knee-high. He goes forward in an attitude of humility and dejection, and knocks the ground
          hard with his elbows, then stands with bowed head and bent back listening to what he says. If anyone addresses
          the king and receives a reply from him, he uncovers his back and throws dust over his head and back, for all
          the world like a bather splashing himself with water. I used to wonder how it was they did not blind
          themselves. If the sultan delivers any remarks during his audience, those present take off their turbans and
          put them down, and listen in silence to what he says. Sometimes one of them stands up before him and recalls
          his deeds in the sultan’s service, saying “I did so-and- so on such a day” or “I killed so-and-so on such a
          day.” Those who have knowledge of this confirm his words, which they do by plucking the cord of the bow and
          releasing it [with a twang], just as an archer does when shooting an arrow. If the sultan says “Truly spoken”
          or thanks him, he removes his clothes and “dusts.” That is their idea of good manners.

          [the Mandingo] came to our master Abu'l-Hasan as envoy from Mansá Sulaymán, one of his suite carried with him
          a basketful of dust when he entered the noble audience-hall, and the envoy ‘dusted’ whenever our master spoke
          a gracious word to him, just as he would do in his own country." [page 327]

            Mállí
          </a>
          during the two festivals of the sacrifice and the fast-breaking. On these days the sultan takes his seat on
          the pempi after the mid-afternoon prayer. The armour-bearers bring in magnificent arms—quivers of gold and
          silver, swords ornamented with gold and with golden scabbards, gold and silver lances, and crystal maces. At
          his head stand four amírs driving off the flies, having in their hands silver ornaments resembling
          saddle-stirrups. The commanders, qádí, and preacher sit in their usual places. The interpreter Dúghá comes
          with his four wives and his slave-girls, who are about a hundred in number. They are wearing beautiful robes,
          and on their heads they have gold and silver fillets, with gold and silver balls attached. A chair is placed
          for Dúghá to sit on. He plays on an instrument made of reeds, with some small calabashes at its lower end, and
          chants a poem in praise of the sultan, recalling his battles and deeds of valour. The women and girls sing
          along with him and play with bows. Accompanying them are about thirty youths, wearing red woollen tunics and
          white skull-caps; each of them has his drum slung from his shoulder and beats it. Afterwards come his boy
          pupils who play and turn wheels in the air, like the natives of Sind. They show a marvellous nimbleness and
          agility in these exercises and play most cleverly with swords. Dúghá also makes a fine play with the sword.
          Thereupon the sultan orders a gift to be presented to Dúghá and he is given a purse containing two hundred
          mithqáls of gold dust, and is informed of the contents of the purse before all the people. The commanders rise
          and twang their bows in thanks to the sultan. The next day each one of them gives Dúghá a gift, every man
          according to his rank. Every Friday after the ‘asr prayer, Dúghá carries out a similar ceremony to this that
          we have described. [page 328 ]
          <br />
          <br />
          On feast-days, after Dúghá has finished his display, the poets come in. Each of them is inside a figure
          resembling a thrush, made of feathers, and provided with a wooden head with a red beak, to look like a
          thrush's head. They stand in front of the sultan in this ridiculous make-up and recite their poems. I was told
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="135">that their poetry is a kind of sermonizing in which they say to the sultan</a> :
          “This pempi which you occupy was that whereon sat this king and that king, and such and such were this one's
          noble actions and such and such the other’s. So do you too do good deeds whose memory will outlive you.” After
          that, the chief of the poets mounts the steps of the pempi and lays his head on the sultan’s lap, then climbs
          to the top of the pempi and lays his head first on the sultan’s right shoulder and then on his left, speaking
          all the while in their tongue, and finally he comes down again. I was told that this practice is a very old
          custom amongst them, prior to the introduction of Islám, and that they have kept it up.

          The negroes disliked Mansá Sulaymán because of his avarice. His predecessor was Mansá Maghá, and before him

          four thousand mithqáls in the course of a single day. I heard from a trustworthy source that he gave three
          thousand mithqáls on one day to Mudrik ibn Faqqús, by whose grandfather his own grandfather, Sáraq Játa, had
          been converted to Islám.

          The negroes possess some admirable qualities. They are seldom unjust, and have a greater abhorrence of
          injustice than any other people. Their sultan shows no mercy to anyone who is guilty of the least act of it.
          There is complete security in their country. Neither traveller nor inhabitant in it has anything to fear from
          robbers of men of violence. They do not [page 329] confiscate the property of any white man who dies in their
          country, even if it be uncounted wealth. On the contrary, they give it into the charge of some trustworthy
          person among the whites, until the rightful heir takes possession of it. They are careful to observe the hours
          of prayer, and assiduous in attending them in congregations, and in bringing up their children to them. On
          Fridays, if a man does not go early to the mosque, he cannot find a corner to pray in, on account of the
          crowd. It is a custom of theirs to send each man his boy [to the mosque] with his prayer-mat; the boy spreads
          it out for his master in a place befitting him [and remains on it] until he comes to the mosque. Their
          prayer-mats are made of the leaves of a tree resembling a date-palm, but without fruit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another of their
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="137">good qualities is their habit of wearing clean white garments</a> on Fridays.
          Even if a man has nothing but an old worn shirt, he washes it and cleans it, and wears it to the Friday
          service. Yet another is their zeal for learning the Koran by heart. They put their children in chains if they
          show any backwardness in memorizing it, and they are not set free until they have it by heart. I visited the
          qádí in his house on the day of the festival. His children were chained up, so I said to him “Will you not let
          them loose?” He replied “I shall not do so until they learn the Koran by heart.” Among their bad qualities are
          the following. The women servants, slave-girls, and young girls
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="138">go about in front of everyone naked, without a stitch of clothing on them.</a>

          they had gone into the river, so I said to Abú Bakr “What kind of animals are these?” He replied “They are
          hippopotami which have come out to pasture ashore.” They are bulkier than horses, have manes and tails, and
          their heads are like horses’ heads, but their feet like elephants’ feet. I saw these hippopotami again when we
          sailed down the Nile from
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="[68]">
            Tumbuktú

            Gawgaw
          </a>
          . They were swimming in the water, and lifting their heads and blowing. The men in the boat were afraid of
          them and kept close to the bank in case the hippopotami should sink them.
          <br />
          <br />
          They have a cunning method of catching these hippopotami. They use spears with a hole bored in them, through
          which strong cords are passed. The spear is thrown at one of the animals, and if it strikes its leg or neck it
          goes right through it. Then they pull on the rope until the bead is brought to the bank, kill it and eat its
          flesh. Along the bank there are quantities of hippopotamus bones.[page 331]
          <br />
          <br />
          We halted near this channel at a large village, which had as governor a negro, a pilgrim, and man of fine
          character, named Farbá Maghá. He was one of the negroes who made the pilgrimage in the company of Sultan Mansá
          Músá. Farbá Maghá told me that when Mansá Músá came to this channel, he had with him a qádí, a white man. This
          qádí attempted to make away with four thousand mithqáls and the sultan, on learning of it, was enraged at him
          and exiled him to the country of the heathen cannibals. He lived among them for four years, at the end of
          which the sultan sent him back to his own country. The reason why the heathens did not eat him was that he was
          white, for they say that the white is indigestible because he is not “ripe,” whereas the black man is “ripe”
          in their opinion.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sultan Mansá Sulaymán was visited by a party of these negro cannibals, including one of their amírs. They have
          a custom of wearing in their ears large pendants, each pendant having an opening of half a span. They wrap
          themselves in silk mantles, and in their country there is a gold mine. The sultan received them with honour,
          and gave them as his <a data-ip-footnote-id="140">hospitality-gift</a> a servant, a negress. They killed and
          ate her, and having smeared their faces and hands with her blood came to the sultan to thank him. I was
          informed that this is their regular custom whenever they visit his court. Someone told me about them that they
          say that the choicest parts of women’s flesh are the palm of the hand and the breast.
          <br />

          We continued our journey from this village which is by the channel, and came to the town of Qurí Mansá.

          At this point the camel which I was riding died. Its keeper informed me of its death, but when I went out to
          see it, I found that the blacks had already eaten it, according to their usual custom of eating carrion. I
          sent two lads whom I had hired for my [page 332] service to buy me a camel at Zágharí, and waited at Qurí
          Mansá for six days till they returned with it.

          Thence we went on to Tumbuktú, which stands four miles from the river. Most of its inhabitants are of the
          Massúfa tribe, wearers of the face-veil. Its governor is called Farbá Músá. I was present with him one day
          when he had just appointed one of the Massúfa to be amír of a section. He assigned to him a robe, a turban,
          and trousers, all of them of dyed cloth, and bade him sit upon a shield, and the chiefs of his tribe raised
          him on their heads. In this town is the grave of the meritorious poet Abú Isháq as-Sáhilí, of Gharnáta

          I sailed down the Nile on a small boat, hollowed out of a single piece of wood. We used to go ashore every
          night at the villages and buy whatever we needed in the way of meat and butter in exchange for salt, spices,
          and glass beads. I then came to a place the name of which I have forgotten, where there was an excellent
          governor, a pilgrim, called Farbá Sulaymán.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="141"

          >
          I have not seen anyone among the blacks taller or bulkier than him. At this town I was in need of some millet,
          so I visited him (it was on the Prophet’s birthday) and saluted him. He took me by the hand, and led me into
          his audience hall. We were served with a drink of theirs called daqnú, which is water containing some pounded
          millet mixed with a little honey or milk. They drink this in place of water, because if they drink plain water
          it upsets them. If they have no millet they mix the water with honey or milk. Afterwards a green melon was
          brought in and we ate some of it.[page 333]
          <br />
          <br />
          A young boy, not yet full-grown, came in, and Farbá Sulaymán, calling him, said to me “Here is your
          hospitality-gift; keep an eye on him in case he escapes.” So l took the boy and prepared to withdraw, but he
          said “Wait till the food comes.” A slave-girl of his joined us; she was an Arab girl, of Damascus, and she
          spoke to me in Arabic. While this was going on we heard cries in his house, so he sent the girl to find out
          what had happened. She returned to him and told him that a daughter of his had just died. He said “I do not
          like crying, come, we shall walk to the river,” meaning the Nile, on which he has some houses. A horse was
          brought, and he told me to ride, but I said “I shall not ride if you are walking,” so we walked together. We
          came to his houses by the Nile, where food was served, and after we had eaten I took leave of him and
          withdrew. <a data-ip-footnote-id="142">I met no one among the blacks more generous or upright than him.</a>

          It is also one of their biggest and best-provisioned towns, with rice in plenty, milk, and fish, and there is
          a species of cucumber there called ‘inání which has no equal. The buying and selling of its inhabitants is
          done with cowry-shells, and the same is the case at Mállí.

            [33]

          I stayed there about a month, and then set out in the direction of Tagaddá by land with a large caravan of
          merchants from Ghadámas. Their guide and leader was the pilgrim Wuchín, which means “wolf” in the language of
          the blacks. I had a riding-camel and a she-camel to carry my provisions, but when we had travelled the first
          stage, the she-camel could go no farther. So the pilgrim Wuchín took what was on it and distributed it amongst
          his party, each of whom undertook to carry apart of it. There was in the company a Maghrabin [page 334]
          belonging to Tádalá, who refused to carry any of it at all, as the rest had done. My boy was thirsty one day,
          and I asked this man for water, but he would not give it.
          <br />
          <br />
          We now entered the territory of the Bardáma, who are a tribe of Berbers. No caravan can travel [through their
          country] without a guarantee of their protection, and for this purpose a woman’s guarantee is of more value
          than a man’s. Their women are the most perfect in beauty and the most shapely in figure of all women, of a
          pure white colour and very stout; nowhere in the world have I seen any who equal them in stoutness.

          I fell ill in this country on account of the extreme heat, and a surplus of bile. We pushed on rapidly with
          our journey until we reached

            Tagaddá

          colour and taste are affected. There are no grain crops there except a little wheat, which is consumed by
          merchants and strangers. The inhabitants of Tagaddá have no occupation except
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="144">trade</a>. They travel to Egypt every year, and import quantities of all the fine
          fabrics to be had there and of other Egyptian wares. They live in luxury and ease, and vie with one another in
          regard to the number of their slaves and serving-women. The people of Mállí and Iwálátan do the same. They
          never sell the educated female slaves, or but rarely and at a high price.

          can show me where to find another, I shall cancel it for you.” He suggested a servant belonging to ‘Alí
          Aghyúl, who was that very Maghrabin [page 335] from Tádalá who had refused to carry any of my effects when my
          camel broke down, and to give my boy water when he was thirdly. So I bought her from him (she was better than
          the former one) and cancelled the sale with the first man. Afterwards this Maghrabin too repented of having
          sold the servant and wished to have the sale cancelled. He was very insistent about it but I refused, simply
          to pay him back for his vile conduct. He was like to go mad or die of grief, but afterwards I cancelled his

          their male and female slaves. When they obtain the red copper, they make it into bars a span and a half in
          length, some thin and others thick. The thick bars are sold at the rate of four hundred for a mithqál of gold,
          and the thin at the rate of six or seven hundred to the mithqál. They serve also as their medium of exchange;
          with the thin bars they buy meat and firewood, with the thick, slaves, male and female, millet, butter, and
          wheat. The copper is exported from Tagaddá to the town of Kúbar, in the regions of the heathens, to Zagháy,

          town. So I hired a guide, and set out thither. He was informed of [page 336] my coming and came to see me,
          riding a horse without a saddle, as is their custom. In place of a saddle he had a gorgeous saddle-cloth, and
          he was wearing a cloak, trousers, and turban, all in blue. With him were his sister’s sons, who are the heirs
          to his kingdom. We rose at his approach, and shook his hand, then he asked about me and my arrival, and was
          told my story. He had me lodged in one of the tents of the Yanátibún, who are like the wusfán in our country,

          and his sister; they came to visit us and saluted us, and his mother used to send us milk after the time of
          evening-prayer, which is their milking time. They drink it at that time and again in early morning, but of
          cereal foods they neither eat nor know. I stayed with them six days, and every day received from the sultan

          reached the place at which the Ghát road, leading to Egypt, and the Tawát road divide. Here there are

          Khurásán, and the lands of the Turks, but never have I seen anything worse than the road of Umm Junayba. On
          the eve of the Festival we reached Dár at-Tama‘. I stayed there during the day of the feast and then went on.
          So I arrived at the royal city of Fa’s [Fez], the capital of our master the Commander of the Faithful (may God
          strengthen him), where I kissed his beneficent hand and was privileged to behold his gracious countenance.

          the place of Ghána as the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade-route in the thirteenth century (see
          note 21 below), being built (according to Hartmann, Mit. Sim. Or. Stud., XV 3, 162) on the site of the old

          These trees were introduced for that purpose into the Eastern Sudan (Kordofan) from West Africa in the
          eighteenth century, but from Ibn Battúta’s description it would appear that artificial hollowing was not yet

          being equivalent to the modern use of the term Mande or Mandingo, which is properly the name of the Malinke.
          Both Malinke and Soninke belong to the same family, the latter to its northern group and the former to its

          southern Algeria, round Ghardaia. The latter are noted for their enterprise and success in trade, but hold (or
          are held) very much aloof from the orthodox Muslim population, and it is probable that the community mentioned

          15 The Límiyún of Ibn Battuta are taken by Delafosse and Marquart to be the inhabitants of the Kebbe (Kiba)
          disctrict. There is, however, a great deal to be said in favour of Cooley’s view that the Límís are identical
          with the Lamlam mentioned by other Arabic geographers, and placed by the geographer Bakrí (who calls them
          Damdam) on the Niger below Gaogao. The latter word unquestionably means “Cannibals,” and is not the name of a
          specific tribe. In the Fulbe language it became nyam-nyam (from Fulbe nyám = cat), which is variously
          reproduced as nam-nam and yam-yam in Arabic script. The term was current also on the east coast of Africa in
          both forms. Ibn Battúta (above, p. 112) heard at Kilwa that gold dust was brought to Sofála from “Yúfí in the

          19 The name Mállí is the Fulani pronunciation of Mande or Manding, and was strictly the name of the ruling
          tribe, not of the town. The site of the latter has long been a matter of controversy. Cooley (pp. 81-2) placed
          it near Segu, at a village called Binni “seven miles above Samee,” and took the Sansara river to be a channel
          of the Niger. Delafosse (H.S.N., II, 181) accepts the view that the site of Malli was “a place situated on the
          left bank of the Niger, S.W. of Niamina and S.S.W. of Moribugu, level with the villages of Konina and Kondu. .
          . . Malli lay therefore a little to the west of the present road from Niamina to Kulikoro.” The name Sansara,
          given by Ibn Battúta to the stream ten miles north of Mállí, was found by Barth to be still applied to the
          small tributary which joins the Niger just below Niamina. Marquart (105, 191) prefers Cooley’s view, but puts
          Mállí a little lower down the river, a day’s march above Sille (Sele), and identifies it with Kúgha or Júga,
          the Quioquia of the Portuguese.<br /><br />[Since the writing of this note and preparation of the map, I find

          was situated “near the present village of Nyani, on the left bank of the Sankarani, a little to the north of
          Balandugu and to the south of Jeliba (Diéliba), the other capital of the same empire,” i.e. at 11.22 N., 8.18

          21 The following is a brief account of the early negro empires.<br /><br />The earliest Sudanic empire was
          that of Ghána (which was really the title of its later Soninke rulers). This empire was founded about the
          fourth century, apparently by some white immigrants. The site of its capital seems to have changed more than
          once. From the ninth to the eleventh century the Soninke of Kumbi were masters of the Ghána empire, until its
          destruction by the Almoravids of Morocco in 1076. A number of small states were constituted on its ruins and
          one of these, the Soninke dynasty of the Kannte, whose capital was at Sosso (to the west of Sansanding),
          recaptured Ghána in 1203 and restored the Soninke empire. To this was due also the foundation of Waláta, as
          the Muslim inhabitants of Ghána, refusing to live under infidel rule, established themselves at the
          water-point of Waláta or Bírtú (see note 6). The conqueror, Sumanguru, was killed in battle in 1235 with the
          Malinke, whose king Sunjáta or Márí Játa annexed the Soninke empire, was converted to Islam (seep. 329), and
          established the new capital at Mállí. He captured and destroyed Ghána in 1240, and died in 1255. After a
          succession of rulers, the next emperor of importance was Músá (Ibn Battúta’s Mansá Músá), in whose reign
          (1307-32) the Mállí empire reached its widest dimensions. Másá was the grandson of a sister of Sunjáta. The
          reign of his son and successor Mansá Maghán (1332-6) marks a brief retrogression, but under Músá’s brother
          Sulaymán (1336-59), the Mállí regained much of their power and prestige. With his death there set in a sharp
          decline, accentuated by civil wars. The Mállí kingdom, however, still remained the most powerful of the Niger
          states until the rise of the Songhay kingdom (see note 32), and did not finally disappear until 1670.

          but also the trans-continental trade-route. Early in the eleventh century it became the capital of the state
          of Songhay (Songhoy), on the conversion to Islam of the first Songhay dynasty, which is said to have been of
          Berber origin. The Songhay kingdom was annexed to Mállí by Mansá Músá in 1325, but in 1335 the dynasty was
          re-established (with the title of sonni), though it still remained in at least nominal subjection to Mállí
          until the reign of Sonní ‘Alí (1465-92), the last ruler of the original Berber line, who enlarged his kingdom
          chiefly at the expense of Mállí. He was succeeded by his Soninke general Muhammad (1493-1529), the founder of
          the askia dynasty, who brought Songhay to the height of its power. The Songhay empire was broken up and the

          35 Tagaddá or Takaddá was at this time the largest town in the Tuareg country. Its Berber sultan, who was
          nominally subject to the Emperor of Mállí, is probably to be regarded as the ruling chief of the Massúfa
          (Sanhája). The problem of the site of Tagaddá is not yet cleared up. It is generally taken, on the basis of
          Barth’s identification, to be Tegidda n’Tisemt, 97 miles W.N.W. of Agades. Barth added that although “nothing
          is known of the existence of copper hereabouts,” a red salt is obtained from mines there. Gautier and Chudeau
          (Missions au Sahara , II, 257) also remark on the absence of copper in the Sahara except at Tamegroun in the
          Ougarta range (29.15 X., i.f.o W.), and state that all the copper used in Air and in Ahaggar comes from
          Europe. The absence of copper at Tegidda is confirmed by F. R. Rodd, who thinks that Ibn Battúta’s Tagaddá
          must be looked for “at some considerable distance south of Agades” (People of the Veil, 452-6). The meaning of
          the word Tegidda according to the latter, is “a small hollow where water collects” and the name is applied to
          a number of different places (Cf. H.S.N., II, 193; Marquart, 98). The exigence of copper mines at Tagaddá is,
          however, confirmed by al-‘Omarí on the authority of Mansá Músá (tr. Demomfbynes, I, 80-81).

          Chapter 13 Mali
          <blockquote>
            The people of Mali outnumbered the peoples of the Sudan in their neighborhood and dominated the whole region
            . . . Their authority became mighty and all the peoples of the Sudan stood in awe of them.[1]<br /><br />Ibn
            Khaldun
          </blockquote>
          <br />When Ibn Battuta visited Cairo in 1326 on his way to his first <i>hajj</i>, the population was
          undoubtedly still talking about the extraordinary pilgrim who had passed through the city two years earlier.
          Mansa Musa, ruler of the West African empire of Mali, had arrived at the Nile in the summer of 1324 after
          having crossed the Sahara Desert with a retinue of officials, wives, soldiers, and slaves numbering in the
          thousands and a train of one hundred camels loaded with unworked gold. A handsome young king of piety and
          noble bearing, he had created a minor sensation among Cairo’s protocol-conscious officials by refusing to kiss
          the ground before the Mamluk sultan, al-Nasir Muhammad. Yet he “flooded Cairo with his benefactions,” writes
          the historian al-Umari, and “performed many acts of charity and kindness.”[2]<br /><br />Having come so far
          from their distant grassland kingdom, the emperor and his gold-heavy entourage spent freely and
          indiscriminately in the Cairo bazaars, like prosperous and naive tourists from some American prairie state.
          “The Cairenes,” says al-Umari, “made incalculable profits out of him and his suite in buying and selling and
          giving and taking. They exchanged gold until they depressed its value in Egypt and caused its price to
          fall.”[3]<br /><br />Musa was not the first <i>mansa</i> (king, sultan) of Mali to go on pilgrimage to Mecca,
          but none before had made such a dazzling display of pomp and riches. Well into the next century Egyptian
          chroniclers wrote about the event and its disturbing short-term effects on the Cairene gold market. In the
          history of medieval West Africa no single incident has been more celebrated. Indeed the <i>hajj</i> of Mansa
          Musa sums up Mali’s important place among the kingdoms of Africa and Asia in Ibn Battuta’s time.<br /><br />The
          unworked gold which the <i>mansa</i> showered on Cairo came from three major alluvial deposits in West Africa.
          The mines of the <i>bilad al-sudan</i>, or simply the Sudan, as the Arab geographers called the steppe and
          savanna region south of the Sahara, had been known to the Mediterranean world since Phoenician times. But it
          was only the introduction of the dromedary to North Africa about the second century A.D. that made feasible in
          terms of costs and risks regular caravan trade from one rim of the Western Sahara to the other. The one-humped
          camel is a difficult and disagreeable animal, but he could carry a load of 125–150 kilograms, go without water
          ten days or more, and travel faster than any other available beast of burden. When Islam reached the Western
          Maghrib in the seventh century, Berber-speaking merchants were already running camel caravans to commercial
          settlements on the far side of the desert.<br /><br />The founding of the Arab Empire and later the High
          Caliphate created an ever-growing demand in the Islamic heartland for West African gold to make coins and
          finery. This demand impelled Muslim merchants and cameliers of the Maghrib and the North Sahara to organize
          trans-desert business and transport operations to an unprecedented level of sophistication. About the same
          time, the Kingdom of Ghana emerged in the steppe region of West Africa known as the Sahel (Sahal), the
          transitional climatic zone between the southern desert and the savanna lands. The appearance of Ghana as an
          imperial state was undoubtedly linked to the gold trade, which encouraged the rise of military leaders
          aggressive enough to seize monopolistic authority over the commercial routes and settlements leading from the
          gold fields deep in the Sudan to the “ports” at the edge of the desert where the North African caravans
          arrived. The empire declined in the eleventh century, perhaps in connection with a prolonged drought, and
          eventually withered away.<br /><br />Yet the pattern of imperial state-building in the Sudan continued with
          the rise of Mali early in the thirteenth century. The founders of this kingdom were Malinke-speaking people
          whose homeland was the region between the upper valleys of the Senegal and the Niger Rivers. This region was
          in the heart of the savanna and much nearer to the two gold-bearing areas, known as Bambuk and Bure, than the
          center of Ghana had been. The early kings of Mali, members of a chiefly clan of the Malinke known as the
          Keita, succeeded in taking control of territory between the gold fields and the Sahel, thereby positioning
          themselves to exact tribute in gold from the producing populations. In this way the cycle of expansion began.
          The gold revenues of the <i>mansas</i> permitted heavier expenditures on the army, which was comprised mainly
          of infantry bowmen and armored cavalry. As the royal forces were deployed across the fertile grasslands both
          east and west, greater numbers of farming and herding folk were subdued and taxed, expanding the wealth and
          military energies of the state even more.<br /><br />In the course of the thirteenth and early fourteenth
          centuries, the <i>mansas</i> extended their domains westward to the Atlantic coast, eastward past the great
          bend of the Niger, and northward to the commercial towns scattered along the Saharan fringe, building an
          empire that incorporated many non-Malinke peoples. By achieving political domination over a band of steppe and
          savanna some 1,200 miles long at the peak of the empire, they effectively controlled and taxed the north–south
          flow of commerce across the Western Sudan.<br /><br />Indeed, Mali’s high age from the mid thirteenth to the
          mid fourteenth century corresponded to the period when Europe was exchanging silver for gold as its principal
          currency, prompting Italian and Catalan merchants to offer higher and higher prices for the little bags of
          dust and nuggets that were transported across the Sahara and over the Atlas Mountains to Ceuta and other North
          African ports. The rising European demand for gold, added to the perennial market in the Islamic states,
          stimulated more gold production in the Sudan, to the enormous fiscal advantage of Mali. In the later medieval
          period overall, West Africa may have been producing almost two-thirds of the world’s gold supply.[4]<br /><br />In
          addition to gold, north-bound caravans carried numerous products originating either in the grasslands or the
          tropical forests — ivory, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, gum resins, hides, and slaves. In return for these
          goods the southbound trade brought many products from North Africa and the Mediterranean basin: textiles,
          copper, silver, books, paper, swords, iron ware, perfumes, jewelry, spices, wheat, and dried fruits. Horses,
          which did not prosper in the deep savanna country owing to the lethal bite of the tsetse fly, were imported
          from the Maghrib to meet the needs of the Malian cavalry. Cowrie shells were used as a form of currency in the
          Sudan, as they were in India. As Ibn Battuta attests, they were harvested exclusively in the Maldive Islands,
          then exported to West Africa by way of Egypt and the Maghrib ports. The single most precious commodity
          imported to the Sudan was salt, a food essential to the human body that West Africa was unable to produce in
          sufficient quantity to meet demand. Salt came from mines in the Sahara and was transported southward in the
          form of giant slabs, two to a camel.<br /><br />In the fourteenth century that section of the West
          Africa-to-Europe commercial exchange system extending from the northern edge of the rain forest to the
          Mediterranean coast was entirely in the hands of Muslims. Indeed from a global perspective the trans-Saharan
          trade routes were north–south branch lines of the hemispheric Muslim network that extended right across
          northern Africa and Asia to the ports of the South China Sea. As early as the ninth century, Berber-speaking
          merchants settled in commercial centers in the Sahel belt, where they acted as hosts and business agents for
          fellow Muslims who organized caravans in the corresponding entrepôts along the northern rim of the desert. In
          the time of Ghana, Muslim towns rose up alongside older Sahelian centers. In these new towns merchants of
          North African Berber or Arab origin were permitted by royal authority to govern their internal affairs
          according to the standards of the Sacred Law, just as they were beginning to do among non-Muslim peoples in
          the Indian Ocean basin.<br /><br />These expatriate merchants did not organize the trade directly to the gold
          fields or to the towns deep in the savanna. That stretch of the network remained under the control of
          professional Sudanese traders. Most of them were of the Soninke and, later, Malinke culture groups. These men
          were among the first West Africans to convert to Islam, thereby linking themselves into the brotherhood of
          shared norms and trust that encouraged order and routine along the trans-Saharan system.<br /><br />As in
          India and Southeast Asia, the founding of new Muslim trading communities created an immediate demand for
          literate cadres to organize and superintend Islamic worship, education, and law. From the beginning of Islamic
          expansion into West Africa, Maghribi men of learning were accompanying the merchant caravans across the desert
          to settle in the towns of the Sahel. These centers supported Islamic education south of the Sahara, and over
          the course of time gave rise to a class of Muslims grounded in the “normative” traditions of piety and
          scholarship as preached and practiced in North Africa. In the period of the Mali empire the communities of
          <i>’ulama</i> in the Sahelian towns included families of both Arabo-Berber and Sudanese origin, the latter
          mainly Malinke or Soninke. Deeper in the Sudan, learned families of purely West African origin
          predominated.<br /><br />Sudanese chiefs and petty kings are known to have converted to Islam as early as the
          tenth or eleventh centuries. Whatever purely religious feelings may have motivated such men individually,
          conversion enhanced their esteem among Muslim merchants, the economically most powerful group in the land, and
          potentially tied them into a much wider commercial and diplomatic world than they had known before. The
          origins of Islam among the Malinke are obscure. In their tradition the founder of the empire was Sunjata (or
          Mari-Jaata), a larger-than-life homeric figure of the early thirteenth century who rose from physical
          adversity and exile to rid his homeland of an alien tyrant, then rebuilt the Malinke capital and ruled from it
          for 25 years. The reign of Sunjata is only vaguely associated with Islam, but at some point in the thirteenth
          century his successors made it the official religion of state, an act certainly linked to the growing
          importance of the Muslim mercantile communities which inhabited the main towns along the trans-savanna
          routes.<br /><br />Yet the military and political success of the <i>mansas</i> also depended on the continuing
          allegiance and cooperation of the mass of their subjects — farming, fishing, and herding people who for the
          most part adhered to ancient animistic beliefs and rituals, not Islam. Unlike the sultans of Delhi, the
          <i>mansas</i> had not come to power as foreign invaders, prepared to organize a state as formally Islamic as
          they pleased. The legitimacy of their authority rested to a large extent on satisfying traditional Malinke
          expectations in their public conventions and ceremonies. Consequently, they were obliged to walk a narrow line
          between their urban Muslim subjects, who wanted them to behave up to the public standards of their Marinid or
          Mamluk counterparts, and the vast majority of the tax- and tribute-paying population, which took no notice of
          Maliki law or proper procedures at Friday prayer<br /><br />The character of official ritual and
          administration as more or less Islamic probably depended on the ruler’s perception of the relative importance
          of his Muslim and non-Muslim subjects from one period to the next. Mansa Musa was naturally a great favorite
          of Muslim opinion, both in Mali and the wider Islamic world. His prestige resulted not only from his
          sensational pilgrimage, but also, writes al-Umari, because<br />
          <blockquote>
            he built ordinary and cathedral mosques and minarets, and established the Friday observances, and prayers in
            congregation, and the muezzin’s call. He brought jurists of the Malikite school to his country and there
            continued as sultan of the Muslims and became a student of religious sciences.[5]
          </blockquote>
          <br />Yet Mansa Musa also reigned during a period when relations with the Muslim merchants and with the states
          of North Africa were particularly important owing to the strong market for gold.<br /><br />This expansive
          period in the trans-Saharan trade continued into the reign of Musa’s brother Sulayman, who came to the throne
          about 1341. Sulayman came close to matching his brother’s reputation for Islamic leadership and piety.
          Moreover, he ruled Mali in prosperity and peace. He was the sort of king from whom Ibn Battuta had come to
          expect an honorable and large-hearted reception.<br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />1. Abu Zayd ’Abd

          In the autumn of 1351 the relentless traveler set out from Fez to visit Mali. He says nothing in the
          <i>Rihla</i> to explain why he felt impelled to cross the Sahara Desert. We may suppose he had the usual
          private plans to seek favor from yet another Muslim court. Obsessive traveler that he was, he may even have
          been urged on by the knowledge that the Sudan was the one important corner of the Dar al-Islam he had not yet
          seen.[6]<br /><br />Some modern historians have suggested that Sultan Abu ’Inan appointed him as a state envoy
          to the emperor. Both Mansa Musa and Mansa Sulayman had initiated diplomatic exchanges with Abu l’Hasan, Abu
          ’Inan’s father. Because of the Marinid campaign to conquer all of North Africa and thereby control the
          northern termini of the trans-Saharan trade from the Atlantic to Ifriqiya, the rulers of Mali had abundant
          reason to cultivate good relations with their northern neighbor. Abu ’Inan certainly knew that Ibn Battuta was
          making the journey and expected him to report in detail upon his return to Fez. Yet there is no convincing
          evidence that this Tangierian faqih, who was little known in Morocco’s official circles, had anything like the
          ambassadorial status he had enjoyed (with such disastrous results) under Muhammad Tughluq.[7]<br /><br />Traveling
          due south from Fez across the ranges of the Middle and High Atlas Mountains, he arrived in Sijilmasa, the
          pre-eminent desert port of the Western Maghrib, after a journey of eight or nine days. Sijilmasa lay in the
          midst of an immense oasis called Tafilalt, the last important outpost of sedentary life at the northern edge
          of the void. Today nothing remains of the city except an agglomeration of unremarkable ruins strewn among the
          palm groves. In the fourteenth century it was, according to al-Umari, a place “of imposing palaces, high
          buildings, and tall gates.”[8] Tafilalt’s rich agriculture, fed by a river flowing down out of the Atlas 50
          miles to the north, supported the urban population, including a large resident community of Berber and Arab
          merchants. From the perspective of Mali, Sijilmasa was the chief northern terminus of the trans-Saharan gold
          caravans. Here the products of the savanna and forest were off-loaded, stored in warehouses, and finally
          carried by camel, mule and donkey trains over the mountains to Fez, Marrakesh, Tlemcen, and the Mediterranean
          ports.<br /><br />Ibn Battuta spent about four months in Sijilmasa, waiting for the winter season, when the
          big caravans set out for Walata, their destination at the far side of the desert. During this time he
          purchased camels of his own and fattened them up. When he was in Ceuta some months earlier, he may have become
          acquainted with the al-Bushri family, whose kinsman he had met in China. For he lodged during his entire stay
          in Sijilmasa with one Muhammad al-Bushri, a legal scholar and brother of the al-Bushri of Qanjanfu. “How far
          apart they are,” he remarks blandly in the <i>Rihla</i>.<br /><br />In February 1352 (beginning of Muharram
          753) he set out from Tafilalt with a caravan of “merchants of Sijilmasa andothers.” The leader was a fellow of
          the Masufa Berbers, a herding people of the Western Sahara who appear to have had something close to a
          monopoly on the supply of guards, guides, and drivers on the entire route between Tafilalt and the Sahel. The
          twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi describes the normal routines for traveling safely across “the empty
          waste” that yawned for a thousand miles south of Sijilmasa:<br />
          <blockquote>
            They load their camels at late dawn, and march until the sun has risen, its light has become bright in the
            air, and the heat on the ground has become severe. Then they put their loads down, hobble their camels,
            unfasten their baggage and stretch awnings to give some shade from the scorching heat and the hot winds of
            midday . . . When the sun begins to decline and sink in the west, they set off. They march for the rest of
            the day, and keep going until nightfall, when they encamp at whatever place they have reached . . . Thus the
            traveling of the merchants who enter the country of the Sudan is according to this pattern. They do not
            deviate from it, because the sun kills with its heat those who run the risk of marching at midday.[9]
          </blockquote>
          <br />Twenty-five days out of Sijilmasa the caravan reached the settlement of Taghaza, the main salt-mining
          center of the Western Sahara. The paradox of Taghaza was the grim, treeless desolation of the place set
          against its extreme importance to the entire interregional commercial system. All the southbound caravans took
          on loads of slab salt, since no product was in greater demand in the Sudan. “This is a village with nothing
          good about it,” Ibn Battuta complains. “It is the most fly-ridden of places.” Then he goes on to speak of the
          enormous amounts of gold that changed hands there.<br /><br />The caravan stayed in the village for ten days,
          giving him an opportunity to watch wretched slaves belonging to Masufa proprietors dig slabs out of the open
          mine and tie them against the sides of the dromedaries. He also had the curious experience of sleeping in a
          house and praying in a mosque made entirely of salt blocks, except for the camel-skin roofs. The water of
          Taghaza was brackish, and every bit of food for the laborers, except for camel meat, had to be brought in from
          either Morocco or Mali. More than a century and a half later the Gradana-born traveler Leo Africanus would
          visit Taghaza and find conditions little changed:<br />
          <blockquote>
            Neither have the said diggers of salt any victuals but such as the merchants bring unto them: for they are
            distant from all inhabited places, almost twenty days journey, insomuch that oftentimes they perish for lack
            of food, whenas the merchants come not in due time unto them: Moreover the southeast wind doth so often
            blind them, that they cannot live here without great peril.[10]
          </blockquote>
          <br />Between Taghaza and Walata lay the most dangerous stretch of the journey, almost 500 miles of sand
          desert where the average annual rainfall is a scant five to ten millimeters and where only one watering point
          exists, a place called Bir al-Ksaib (Tasarahla).[11] If rain fell at all in the region, it usually came in
          late winter.[12] Ibn Battuta and his fellows were, according to his chronology, traveling south from Taghaza
          sometime in March. Fortunately, the rain had come that year, leaving pools of water here and there along the
          track, enough in fact for the caravaners to wash out their clothes. Yet there was danger enough in this
          wilderness for all that:<br />
          <blockquote>
            In those days we used to go on ahead of the caravan and whenever we found a place suitable for grazing we
            pastured the beasts there. This we continued to do till a man named Ibn Ziri became lost in the desert.
            After that we neither went on ahead nor lagged behind. Strife and the exchange of insults had taken place
            between Ibn Ziri and his maternal cousin, named Ibn ’Adi, so that he fell behind the caravan and lost the
            way, and when the people encamped there was no news of him.
          </blockquote>
          <br />Arriving safely at Bir al-Ksaib minus Ibn Ziri, the caravan stopped for three days to rest and to repair
          and fill the water skins before navigating the trek across the vast sand desert called Mreyye, the final and
          most dangerous stage of the trip. Keeping to the usual procedure, the company hired a Masufa scout called the
          <i>takshif</i>, whose job it was to go on ahead of the caravan to Walata. If he did not lose his way among the
          dunes, or run out of water, or fall prey to the demons which Ibn Battuta tells us haunted those wastes, he
          would alert the people of the town to the caravan’s approach. A group of Walatans would then be sent four
          days’ journey north to meet the caravan with fresh water.<br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />7. The
          commentaries are divided on the question of Ibn Battuta’s purpose in going to the Sudan. The issue hinges on
          the translation of the phrase <i>bi-rasm al-safar</i> in the Arabic text. One version has it: “I took leave of
          our Master (may God uphold him). I departed with orders to accomplish a journey to the land of the Sudan.” R.
          Mauny et al.,
          <i>Textes et documents relatifs à l’histoire de l’Afrique: extraits tirés des voyages d’Ibn Battuta</i>
          (Dakar, 1966), 35. Levtzion and Hopkins (<i>Corpus</i>, 414), however, believe that this translation “seems to
          read too much “into the text.” They prefer “and set off with the purpose of traveling to the land of the
          Sudan.” Both C. Défrémery and B.R Sanguinetti (trans and eds.), <i>Voyages d’Ibn Battuta</i>, vol. 4 (Paris
          1858, reprint edn Vincent Monteil, ed., Paris 1979), 376, and Said Hamdun and Noel King (trans. And eds.),
          <i>Ibn Battuta in Black Africa</i> (London, 1975), 22, give similar meaning to their translation of the
          phrase. Levtzion (<i>Ghana and Mali</i>, 216) states that Ibn Battuta was “on a private visit to the Sudan”
          but that Abu ’Inan knew of his movements. When Ibn Battuta was at Takadda in the southern Sahara, the sultan
          sent a messenger telling him to return to Fez. I agree with Levtzion. If Ibn Battuta were on an official
          mission to Mali, we might expect him to make a good deal of it in the <i>Rihla</i> or at least refer to it in
          connection with his appearance at the Mali court.<br />8. Al-Umari, in Levtzion and Hopkins, <i>Corpus</i>,

          The Masufa <i>takshif</i> earned the 100 mithqals of gold the caravaners paid him, for on the seventh night
          out of Bir al-Ksaib they saw the lights of the Walata relief party. A few days later, sometime in the latter
          part of April 1352 (beginning of Rabi’ 1753), they reached the sweltering little town. Its mud brick houses
          lay along the slope of a barren hill, a scattering of palm trees in a little wadi below. The site was bleak,
          but as the main southern terminus of the camel trains the town nonetheless supported a population of two or
          three thousand.[13] It ranked as a provincial capital of Mali and had an important community of educated men
          of Berber and Sudanese origin.<br /><br />By a letter entrusted to the <i>takshif</i> Ibn Battuta had arranged
          to rent a house through the good offices of a “respectable” Moroccan trader named Ibn Badda’, who resided in
          the town. Yet as soon as he arrived, he found cause to regret having come at all. Walata was the most
          northerly center under the jurisdiction of the <i>mansa</i>. Following custom, the members of the caravan went
          immediately to pay their respects to the <i>farba</i>, or governor. They found him seated on a carpet under a
          portico, surrounded by lancers, bowmen, and warriors of the Masufa. Though he sat very close to the visitors,
          he addressed them not directly but through a spokesman. In Mali this was proper ceremonial procedure
          symbolizing the sacred character of the <i>mansa</i>, in whose name the <i>farba</i> held his authority. Ibn
          Battuta, however, thought the governor’s behavior a shocking display of bad manners, misinterpreting it as a
          show of contempt for the visiting “white men.”[14] Later, the newcomers all went to receive hospitality from
          one of the governor’s officials. The welcome turned out to be a bowl of millet with a little honey and
          yogurt.<br />
          <blockquote>
            I said to them: “Was it to this that the black man invited us?” They said: “Yes, for them this is a great
            banquet.” Then I knew for certain that no good was to be expected from them and I wished to depart.
          </blockquote>
          <br />He soon got the better of his urge to retreat back to Morocco, but the inclination of the Sudanese to
          combine Islamic practice with regional custom was no end of irritation to him. His prejudice, if he were to
          try to explain it, had nothing directly to do with race. It was a matter of the failure of the Malians to
          conduct themselves according to the normative standards that pious Muslims from North African cities might
          expect of virtuous officers of state. Such standards did not include rulers speaking to fellow believers
          through ritual heralds or entertaining visiting <i>’ulama</i> with small dishes of porridge.<br /><br />The
          incident, unfortunately, was to be only the first of many occasions when Ibn Battuta, the sophisticated Maliki
          jurist, would find the Sudanese coming up short in their attention to moral and legal niceties. He admits that
          the scholars of Walata treated him warmly during his sojourn in the town, but he found their failure to
          subscribe to what he regarded as the civilized rules of sexual segregation even worse than the practices of
          the Central Asian Turks. On one occasion he appeared at the house of the <i>qadi</i> to find him seated in
          casual conversation with a young and beautiful woman. That a woman should be present in the reception room of
          a Muslim’s house when a male guest arrived was bad enough. But the judge’s explanation, that it was all right
          to come in because the woman was his “friend,” made the visitor recoil in shock. On another occasion Ibn
          Battuta paid a call to a Masufa scholar and found this worthy’s wife chatting with a strange man in the
          courtyard. When he expressed profound disapproval of such goings-on, the scholar replied insouciantly that
          “the association of women with men is agreeable to us and a part of good conduct, to which no suspicion
          attaches. They are not like the women of your country.” Unpersuaded, Ibn Battuta left the house at once and
          never came back. “He invited me several times,” he tells us, “but I did not accept.”<br /><br />He stayed in
          Walata several weeks, then started out for the capital of Mali in the company of three companions and a Masufa
          guide. He remarks that he did not need to travel in a caravan because “neither traveler there nor dweller has
          anything to fear from thief or usurper” owing to Mansa Sulayman’s firm government. Nor did he have to carry a
          large stock of supplies. As he moved southward from the Sahelian steppe into the grassy plains, giant baobab
          trees rising stalk-like on the horizon, he encountered village after village of Sudanese farming folk. In them
          he and his comrades offered glass beads and pieces of Taghaza salt in return for millet, rice, milk, chickens,
          and other local staples. After two weeks or more on the road by way of Zaghari (which may be identified with
          the Sokolo area in modern Mali), he reached the left bank of the Niger River at a place he names Karsakhu.[15]
          He calls the river the Nile (Nil), following the mistaken notion of medieval Muslim geographers that that
          great river was a branch of the Egyptian Nile. Whatever his error, the crocodiles here were as dangerous as
          the ones he had seen in Egypt:<br />
          <blockquote>
            One day I had gone to the Nil to accomplish a need when one of the Sudan came and stood between me and the
            river. I was amazed at his ill manners and lack of modesty and mentioned this to somebody, who said: “He did
            that only because he feared for you on account of the crocodile, so he placed himself between you and it.”
          </blockquote>
          <br />The traveler’s precise route from Walata to the Malian capital is a puzzle because we do not know for
          certain where the town was. The <i>Rihla</i> gives neither a name to the place nor a very useful topographical
          description of it. The chief seat of royal power may have changed location from one period to another, indeed
          more than one “capital” may have existed at the same time. Some modern scholars identify the site, at least at
          that time in Mali’s history, with the village of Niani, located south of the Niger in the modern Republic of
          Guinea. But the town may also have lain north of the river somewhere east of Bamako.[16] About ten miles from
          his destination Ibn Battuta crossed what he calls the Sansara River on a ferry (he never mentions crossing the
          Niger). If the capital is to be identified with Niani, that river would have been the Sankarani, a southern
          tributary of the Niger.<br /><br />The seat of Mansa Sulayman was a sprawling, unwalled town set in a “verdant
          and hilly” country.[17] The sultan had several enclosed palaces there. Mansa Musa had built one under the
          direction of Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, an Andalusian architect and poet who had accompanied him home from the
          <i>hajj</i>. Al-Sahili surfaced the building with plaster, an innovation in the Sudan, and “covered it with
          colored patterns so that it turned out to be the most elegant of buildings.”[18] Surrounding the palaces and
          mosques were the residences of the citizenry, mud-walled houses roofed with domes of timber and reed.[19]Ibn
          Battuta arrived in the town on 28 July 1352 (14 Jumada 1753) and went immediately to the quarter where the
          resident merchants and scholars of Maghribi origin lived. He had written to the community in advance of his
          arrival, probably from Walata, and was relieved to learn that his letter had been received and a house made
          ready for him to occupy. Within a day, he made the acquaintance of the <i>qadi</i>, a Sudanese, as well as the
          other members of the Muslim notability. He was also introduced to the <i>mansa’s</i> “interpreter,” or
          <i>griot</i>, a man named Dugha. This official was a Sudanese of special social caste who performed a
          multiplicity of important state functions: master of state ceremonies, royal bard and praise singer, herald,
          confidant, counsellor, and keeper of the oral traditions of the Keita dynasty.<br /><br />Ibn Battuta no doubt
          expected to see the king promptly, but ten days after his arrival he fell grievously sick after eating some
          yams or similar root that may not have been cooked long enough to remove the poison from its skin.[20] He
          fainted away during the dawn prayer, and one of the five men who had shared the meal with him subsequently
          died. Ibn Battuta drank a purgative concoction to induce vomiting, but he remained so ill for two months that
          he could not rouse himself to make an appearance at court.<br /><br />He finally recovered just in time to
          attend a public memorial feast for the deposed and deceased Moroccan sultan Abu l’Hasan, with whom Mali had
          had amicable diplomatic relations. The ceremonies of the <i>mansa’s</i> public sitting were not unlike the
          pageants the traveler had witnessed in dozens of Muslim courts, but elements of traditional Malinke
          chieftaincy were in evidence to be sure:<br />
          <blockquote>
            [The sultan] has a lofty pavilion, of which the door is inside his house, where he sits for most of the time
            . . . There came forth from the gate of the palace about 300 slaves, some carrying in their hands bows and
            others having in their hands short lances and shields . . . Then two saddled and bridled horses are brought,
            with two rams which, they say, are effective against the evil eye . . . Dugha the interpreter stands at the
            gate of the council-place wearing fine garments of silk brocade and other materials, and on his head a
            turban with fringes which they have a novel way of winding . . . The troops, governors, young men, slaves,
            the Masufa, and others sit outside the council-place in a broad street where there are trees . . . Inside
            the council-place beneath the arches a man is standing. Anyone who wishes to address the sultan addresses
            Dugha and Dugha addresses that man standing and that man standing addresses the sultan.<br />
            If one of them addresses the sultan and the latter replies he uncovers the clothes from his back and
            sprinkles dust on his head and back, like one washing himself with water. I used to marvel how their eyes
            did not become blinded.
          </blockquote>
          <br />The <i>qadi</i> and other scholars brought Ibn Battuta forward and presented him to the gold-turbaned
          monarch seated on his dais under a silken dome. There was nothing particularly special about a Moroccan
          <i>faqih</i> passing through the kingdom and this first meeting was perfunctory. Later, when Ibn Battuta had
          returned to his house, one of the scholars called to tell him that the sultan had sent along the requisite
          welcoming gift.<br />
          <blockquote>
            I got up, thinking that it would be robes of honor and money, but behold! it was three loaves of bread and a
            piece of beef fried in gharti [shea butter] and a gourd containing yoghurt. When I saw it I laughed, and was
            long astonished at their feeble intellect and their respect for mean things.
          </blockquote>
          <br />To make matters worse he spent almost another two months attending court before the sultan paid any
          further attention to him. Finally, on the advice of Dugha, he made an appeal to Sulayman, brashly raising the
          issue of the <i>mansa’s</i> prestige among the Muslim rulers of the world:<br />
          <blockquote>
            I have journeyed to the countries of the world and met their kings. I have been four months in your country
            without your giving me a reception gift or anything else. What shall I say of you in the presence of other
            sultans?
          </blockquote>
          <br />In all probability Sulayman could not have cared less what this wandering jurist said of him. At first
          he sublimely disavowed having even known that Ibn Battuta was in the town. But when his notables reminded him
          that he had received the Moroccan a few months earlier and “sent him some food,” the mansa offered him a house
          and an allowance in gold. Notwithstanding the sultan’s desultory effort to put things right, Ibn Battuta never
          got over the indifferent treatment he received, concluding in the <i>Rihla</i> that Sulayman “is a miserly
          king from whom no great donation is to be expected” and that Mansa Musa by contrast had been “generous and
          virtuous.”<br /><br />Ibn Battuta ended a sojourn of a little more than eight months in the capital in a state
          of ambivalence over the qualities of Malian culture. On the one hand he respected Sulayman’s just and stable
          government and the earnest devotion of the Muslim population to their mosque prayers and Qur’anic studies.
          “They place fetters on their children if there appears on their part a failure to memorize the Qur’an,” he
          reports approvingly, “and they are not undone until they memorize it.” On the other hand he reproached the
          Sudanese severely for practices obviously based in Malinke tradition but, from his point of view, either
          profane or ridiculous when set against the model of the rightly guided Islamic state: female slaves and
          servants who went stark naked into the court for all to see; subjects who groveled before the sultan, beating
          the ground with their elbows and throwing dust and ashes over their heads; royal poets who romped about in
          feathers and bird masks. Ibn Battuta seems indeed to be harsher on the Malians than he does on other societies
          of the Islamic periphery where behavior rooted in local tradition, but contrary to his scriptural and legal
          standards, colored religious and social practice. We may sense in his reportage a certain embarrassment that a
          kingdom whose Islam was so profoundly influenced by his own homeland and its Maliki doctors was not doing a
          better job keeping to the straight and narrow.<br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />13. Raymond Mauny,

        <div class="footnote" id="[53]">
          Ibn Battuta left Sulayman’s court on 27 February 1353 (22 Muharram 754), traveling by camel in the company of
          a merchant. Since the location of the capital is uncertain, his itinerary away from it is equally problematic.
          If he had a general plan of travel, it seems to have been to explore the provinces of Mali further down the
          Niger. He mentions that in the ensuing days he crossed, not the great river itself, but a tributary channel,
          which might be identified with the “canal du Sahel,” a northerly flood branch located east of the modern
          Malian town of Ségou.[21] From there he followed a northeasterly route, keeping well to the west of the river,
          then rejoining it again somewhere not far upstream from Timbuktu.<br /><br />In the <i>Rihla</i> Ibn Battuta
          expresses no particular wonder at that legendary “city of gold.” In fact the rise of Timbuktu as a
          trans-Saharan terminus and capital of Islamic learning came mainly in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
          In the mid fourteenth century, when Ibn Battuta passed through, the town was only beginning to flower. It had
          a population of about 10,000 and a Malian governor, who had been installed when Mansa Musa visited the town on
          his return from the Hijaz.[22] It almost certainly had a sizable community of Maghribi and Sudanese scholars.
          According to tradition, Mansa Musa had commissioned an impressive grand mosque.[23] Yet until later in the
          century Timbuktu was junior to Walata as a trade and intellectual center. Ibn Battuta found nothing there to
          detain him for long and was soon on his way down the Niger.<br /><br />At Kabara, Timbuktu’s “port” on the
          river four miles south of the city, he abandoned his dromedary and boarded a small boat, a type of canoe
          (“carved out of a single piece of wood”) that is still used in the region today.[24] From Kabara the Niger
          flows due eastward for about 180 miles through the flat Sahelian steppe. “Each night,” he reports, “we stayed
          in a village and bought what we were in need of in the way of wheat and butter for salt, spices and glass
          trinkets.” At one village he celebrated the Prophet’s Birthday (12 Rabi’ I 754 or 17 April 1353) in the
          company of the local commander, whose generosity the <i>Rihla</i> praises so effusively that the tacit
          negative comparison to Mansa Sulayman is not lost on the reader. The officer not only entertained his visitor
          warmly but even gave him a slave boy as a gift. The lad accompanied Ibn Battuta back across the Sahara and
          remained with him for some years.”<br /><br />Continuing down river, the traveler spent about a month in Gao
          (Kawkaw), a thriving commercial city at the eastern extremity of Mali’s political orbit. Then, having by this
          time crossed a large part of the empire from west to east and visited most of the towns with important Muslim
          populations, he decided to make for home. Gao paralleled Walata and Timbuktu as a terminus of trans-Saharan
          trade, but with relatively more important route connections to Ifriqiya and Egypt. Ibn Battuta found “a big
          caravan” departing from Gao for Ghadamès (Ghadamis), a major stop in the northern desert about 450 miles due
          south of Tunis. He had no plans to go to Ghadamès, but it made sense for him to accompany the convoy as far
          east as the oasis of Takedda (Azelik), which lay to the southwest of the Saharan highland region called
          Air.[25] From there he could expect to intercept a caravan en route to Sijilmasa from the central Sudan (the
          region corresponding to the northern part of modern Nigeria).<br /><br />His journey to Takedda was
          disagreeable. In Gao he purchased a riding camel, as well as a she-camel to carry his provisions. But the
          sweltering desert summer was approaching, and after only one stage on the trail the she-camel collapsed. Other
          travelers among the company agreed to help transport Ibn Battuta’s belongings, but further on he fell sick,
          this time “because of the extreme heat and a surplus of bile.” Stumbling on to Takedda, he found a house in
          which to recuperate as well as a welcoming community of resident Moroccans.<br /><br />Like Taghaza, Takedda
          was a grim spot in the desert important for its mine, in this case copper. Unlike Taghaza, the town was also a
          junction of trade routes and consequently a place of some slight urbanity. Ibn Battuta reports:<br />
          <blockquote>
            The people of Takedda have no occupation but trade. They travel each year to Egypt and import some of
            everything which is there in the way of fine cloth and other things. Its people are comfortable and well off
            and are proud of the number of male and female slaves which they have.
          </blockquote>
          <br />Recovering from his illness, he thought of buying “an educated slave girl” for himself. The effort
          brought nothing but trouble, not least for the unfortunate young women involved. First, the qadi of the town
          got one of the other notables to sell the traveler a girl of his own for a quantity of gold. Then the man
          decided he had made a mistake and asked to buy her back. Ibn Battuta agreed on condition that a replacement be
          found. Another Moroccan in the caravan, a man named ’Ali ’Aghyul, had a woman he was ready to sell. But Ibn
          Battuta and this fellow had already had a personal row. On the journey to Takedda, ’Ali ’Aghyul had not only
          refused to help carry the load from Ibn Battuta’s dead camel but even denied a drink of water to his
          countryman’s slave boy. Nevertheless Ibn Battuta went through with the deal, this girl “being better than the
          first one.” But then<br />
          <blockquote>
            this Moroccan regretted having sold the slave and wished to revoke the bargain. He importuned me to do so,
            but I declined to do anything but reward him for his evil acts. He almost went mad and died of grief. But I
            let him off afterwards.
          </blockquote>
          <br />Some time following this shabby incident, a slave messenger arrived in a caravan from Sijilmasa carrying
          an order from Sultan Abu ’Inan that the <i>faqih</i> should return immediately to Fez. Ibn Battuta offers no
          explanation why the sultan should have kept such close track of his movements south of the Sahara. It seems
          likely that Abu ’Inan was anxious to have a report from him on political and commercial conditions in Mali,
          matters so important to the health of the Marinid state.[26]<br /><br />Ibn Battuta left Takadda on 11
          September 1353 (11 Sha’ban 754) in the company of a large caravan transporting 600 black female slaves to
          Morocco. These unfortunates had probably started out from the savanna lands southeast of Takedda, regions
          which, in the absence of gold deposits, engaged more extensively in slave commerce than did Mali.[27] Once
          arrived in Sijilmasa or Fez, the women would be sold into service as domestics, concubines, or servants of the
          royal court.<br /><br />The caravan trekked northward through 18 days of “wilderness without habitation” to a
          point north of Air (possibly Assiou or In Azaoua,[28] where the route leading to Ghadamès forked off from the
          road to Sijilmasa. From there the convoy skirted the western side of the Ahaggar (Hoggar, or Hukkar) Mountains
          of the central desert. Here they passed through the territory of veiled Berber nomads who, Ibn Battuta informs
          us, were “good for nothing . . . We encountered one of their chief men who held up the caravan until he was
          paid an impost of cloth and other things.”<br /><br />Now veering gradually to the northwest, the company
          eventually reached the great north Saharan oasis complex of Tuwat (Touat). Ibn Battuta mentions only one
          stopping place in this region (Buda), then tells us simply that they continued on to Sijilmasa. He stayed
          there no more than about two weeks, then continued on over the High Atlas in the dead of winter. “I have seen
          difficult roads and much snow in Bukhara, Samarkand, Khurasan and the land of the Turks, but I never saw a
          road more difficult than that.” Somewhere along that frigid highway he halted to celebrate the Feast of
          Sacrifice, 6 January 1354.<br />
          <blockquote>
            Then I departed and reached the capital Fez, capital of our Lord the Commander of the Faithful, may God
            support him, and kissed his noble hand, and deemed myself fortunate to see his blessed face. I remained in
            the shelter of his beneficence after my long travels, may God . . . thank him for the great benefits which
            he bestowed on me and his ample benignity.
          </blockquote>
          <br />Indeed Abu ’Inan could afford to be amply benign, for his reign had just about reached its high point
          when Ibn Battuta returned to the capital. Morocco was generally at peace, and the sultan was even planning for
          the day when he would best his father at conquering Ifriqiya and unifying North Africa once and for all. If
          the Black Death had temporarily deflated Fez’s productiveness in craft and industry, the city was still the
          center of the intellectual universe west of Cairo. Among the stars of saintliness and erudition gathered
          there, Ibn Battuta might expect to shine for a moment or two on the strength of the stories he had to
          tell.”<br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />21. Hunwick, “Mid-Fourteenth Century Capital,” 203.<br /><br />22.

          of Ibn Battuta’s purpose in going to the Sudan. The issue hinges on the translation of the phrase
          <i>bi-rasm al-safar</i> in the Arabic text. One version has it: “I took leave of our Master (may God uphold
          him). I departed with orders to accomplish a journey to the land of the Sudan.” R. Mauny et al.,
          <i>Textes et documents relatifs à l’histoire de l’Afrique: extraits tirés des voyages d’Ibn Battuta</i>
          (Dakar, 1966), 35. Levtzion and Hopkins (<i>Corpus</i>, 414), however, believe that this translation “seems to
          read too much “into the text.” They prefer “and set off with the purpose of traveling to the land of the
          Sudan.” Both C. Défrémery and B.R Sanguinetti (trans and eds.), <i>Voyages d’Ibn Battuta</i>, vol. 4 (Paris

          <i>Ibn Battuta in Black Africa</i> (London, 1975), 22, give similar meaning to their translation of the
          phrase. Levtzion (<i>Ghana and Mali</i>, 216) states that Ibn Battuta was “on a private visit to the Sudan”
          but that Abu ’Inan knew of his movements. When Ibn Battuta was at Takadda in the southern Sahara, the sultan
          sent a messenger telling him to return to Fez. I agree with Levtzion. If Ibn Battuta were on an official
          mission to Mali, we might expect him to make a good deal of it in the <i>Rihla</i> or at least refer to it in
          connection with his appearance at the Mali court.<br /><br />8. Al-Umari, in Levtzion and Hopkins,

          “The Mid-Fourteenth century capital of Mali,” <i>Journal of African History</i> 14 (1973): 199–200. Other
          hypotheses on this stretch of Ibn Battuta’s itinerary are offered by Claude Meillassoux, “L’itinéraire d’Ibn

          fourteenth century capital of Mali. Recent discussions, which also review the earlier literature on the
          problem, are Wladyslaw Filipowiak, <i>Études archéologiques sur la capitale médiévale du Mali</i>, trans.
          Zofia Slawskaj (Szczecin, 1979); Hunwick, “Mid-Fourteenth Century Capital,” 195–206; and Meillassoux,
          “L’itinéraire d’Ibn Battuta,’ 389–95. Hunwick hypothesizes that Ibn Battuta did not visit Niani but a place
          north of the Niger, pointing out that the traveler never mentions crossing the river.<br /><br />17. Al-Umari,

          Battuta’s Takadda with Azelik. Most other commentators agree.<br /><br />26. Jean Devisse presumes that Ibn
          Battuta was on a mission for Abu ’Inan and speculates that the sultan wanted up-to-date intelligence out of
          fear that the gold trade was being increasingly diverted towards Egypt. “Routes de commerce et échanges en

          Hopkins(<i>Corpus</i>, 418n) are doubtful but offer no alternative.<br />

          /><br /><br />The Muslim World (or Dar al-Islam) around 1300<br /><br />Ibn Battuta mainly traveled to places
          with Muslim governments in the areas inside the black border marking the Dar al-Islam. Beyond that, Muslim
          traders had already ventured out into China, Indonesia and further, and had established small Muslim
          communities in many regions of the world. Ibn Battuta would seldom be far from fellow Muslims on his travels,
          and he would greatly benefit from the charity and hospitality offered to Muslim travelers and
          pilgrims.(Introduction from web resource, Nick Bartel, "The Travels of Ibn Battuta,"
