            Leo Africanus, On Timbuktu (1526)
          </b>
          <br />
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            Leo Africanus (c. 1494-c. 1554) was born ai-Hasan ibn Muhammad ai-Wazzan ai-Fasi in Granada. Given the
            difficulties for Muslims in Spain after the expulsion of the Moors, his family joined relatives in Fez,
            where al-Hasan grew up and studied at the university. As a young man he traveled with his uncle throughout
            the Maghreb, going as far south as Timbuktu, then part of the Songhai Empire. He later performed the
            <i>
              hajj
            </i>
            to Mecca, and traveled across the Mediterranean to Istanbul. In 1518 his ship was captured by pirates; he
            was eventually taken to Rome and presented to Pope Leo X. As a man of letters with extensive djpfomatic
            knowledge, he was welcomed at the papal court. He was baptized as Leo Africanus in 1520.
          </blockquote>
          <br />
          <br />
          The historical geography of Africa is Africanus’s best known scholarly work. It was quickly translated from
          Italian and had several printings in the sixteenth century. Although he was well-traveled, it is unlikely that
          Africanus visited all the places he described. Like other early modern writers, he probably relied on relayed
          oral descriptions from other travelers. When Leo Africanus visited Timbuktu, it was a vibrant commercial city
          famous for its wealth and learning.
          <br />

          <hr />
          <br />
          This name was in our times (as some think) imposed upon this kingdom from the name of a certain town, so
          called, which (they say) king Mansa Suleiman founded in the year of the Hegira 610 [1213 CE] and it is
          situated within twelve miles of a certain branch of the Niger. All the houses are now changed into cottages
          built of chalk, and covered with thatch. Howbeit there is a most stately temple [mosque] to be seen, the walls
          whereof are made of stone and lime; and a princely palace also built by a most excellent workman of Granada.
          Here are many shops of artificers [craftspersons], and merchants, and especially of such as weave linen and
          cotton cloth. And hither do the Barbary [North African] merchants bring cloth of Europe.
          <br />
          <br />
          All women of this region go with their faces covered, except maid-servants who sell all necessary victuals.
          The inhabitants and especiall: strangers there residing, are exceedingly rich, insomuch as the king that now
          is, married both his daughters to two rich merchants. Here are many wells containing most sweet water· and so
          often as the river Niger overflows, they convey the water thereof by certain sluices into the town. Grain,
          cattle, milk, and butter this region yields in great abundance, but salt is very scarce here. It is brought
          hither by land from Taghaza [also in modern-day Mali], which is five hundred miles distant. When I myself was
          here, 1 saw one camel load of salt sold for 80 ducats.
          <br />
          <br />
          The rich king of Timbuktu has many plates and scepters of gold some whereof weigh 1300 pounds. He keeps a
          magnificent and well furnished court. When he travels he rides upon a camel which is led by some of his
          noblemen. He does likewise when he goes to war and all his soldiers ride upon horses. Whosoever will speak to
          this king must first fall down before his feet, and then taking up earth must sprmkle It upon his own head and
          shoulders. This custom is ordinarily observed by them that never saluted the king before, or come as
          ambassadors from other princes. He always has three thousand horsemen, and a great number of footmen that
          shoot poisoned arrows, attending on him. They often have skirmishes with those that refuse to pay tribute, and
          so many [prisoners] as they take they sell to the merchants of Timbuktu.
          <br />
          <br />
          Very few horses are bred here. The merchants and courtiers keep certam httle nags which they use to travel
          upon, but their best horses are brought out of Barbary. As soon as the king hears that any merchants are come
          to town with horses, he commands a certain number to be brought before him. Choosing the best for himself he
          pays a most liberal price for them.
          <br />
          <br />
          He so deadly hates all Jews that he will not admit any into his City. Any merchants he understands have
          dealings with Jews, he presently causes their goods to be confiscated.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are a great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men that are bountifully maintained by
          the king’s cost and charge. And hither are brought diverse manuscripts or written books out of Barbary; they
          are sold for more money than any other merchandise.
          <br />
          <br />
          The coin of Timbuktu is of gold without any stamps or superscription. In matters of small value they use
          certain shells brought out of Persia, four hundred of which shells are worth a ducat. Six pieces of their
          golden coin with two thirds parts weigh an ounce.
          <br />
          <br />
          The inhabitants are people of a gentle and cheerful disposition, and spend a great part of the night in
          singing and dancing through all the streets of the city. They keep a great store of men and women slaves.
          Their town is in much danger of fire; at my second visit, half the town was almost burned in five hours time.
          Without the suburbs there are no gardens or orchards at all.
