              Periplus Maris Erythraei
            </i>
            (or ‘Voyage around the Erythraean Sea’) is an<a data-ip-footnote-id="101"> anonymous work</a> from around
            the middle of the first century CE written by a
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="102">Greek speaking Egyptian merchant</a>. The first part of the work (sections
            1-18) describes the <a data-ip-footnote-id="103">maritime trade-routes</a> following the north-south axis
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="104">from Egypt down the coast of East Africa as far as modern day Tanzania</a>. The
            remainder describes the routes of the East-West axis running from Egypt, around the Arabian Peninsula and
            past the Persian Gulf on to the west coast of India.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="105">From the vivid descriptions of the places</a> mentioned it is generally held
            that <a data-ip-footnote-id="106">the author himself traveled to nearly all the lands he describesM</a>. The
            final chapters describe the East Coast of India as far north as the mouth of the Ganges and include reports
            the author had heard of the uncharted lands beyond. The author’s pattern is
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="107">to describe the lengths and conditions of the routes</a>, the key emporiums and
            anchorage points, the disposition of the locals, and the imports and exports of the region. Because the
            annual <a data-ip-footnote-id="108">monsoon</a> winds were the key factor in making the voyage to India the
            author will at times note the month (in both Greek and Egyptian) in which one should sail from Egypt.

          is destitute of harbors, but there are places where <a data-ip-footnote-id="109">ships can lie at anchor</a>,
          the shore being abrupt; and
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="110">this course is of six days, the direction being south-west</a>. Then come the
          small and great beach for another <a data-ip-footnote-id="111">six days'</a> course and after that in order,
          the <a data-ip-footnote-id="112">Courses of Azania</a>, the first being called Sarapion and the next Nicon;
          and after that several rivers and other anchorages, one after the other, separately a rest and a run for each
          day, seven in all, until the Pyralae islands and what is called the channel; beyond which, a little to the
          south of south-west, after two courses of a day and night along the Ausanitic coast, is the island Menuthias,
          about three hundred stadia from the main-land, low and wooded, in which there are rivers and many kinds of
          birds and the mountain-tortoise. There are no
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="113">wild beasts except the crocodiles</a>; but
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="114">there they do not attack men</a>. In this
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="115">place</a> there are sewed boats, and canoes hollowed from single logs, which they
          use for fishing and catching tortoise. In this island they also catch them in a
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="116">peculiar way</a>, in wicker baskets, which they fasten across the channel-opening
          between the breakers.

          <a data-ip-footnote-id="118">continent of Azania</a>, which is called Rhapta; which has its name from the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="119">sewed boats</a> (rhapton ploiarion) already mentioned;<a

          <a data-ip-footnote-id="122">under separate chiefs for each place</a>. The Mapharitic chief governs it under
          some ancient right that subjects it to the sovereignty of the state that is become first in Arabia. And the
          people of Muza now hold it under his authority, and send thither many large ships, using
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="123">Arab</a> captains and agents, who are familiar with the natives and intermarry
          with them, and who know the whole coast and understand the language.
          <br />
          <br />
          17. There are imported into these markets the lances made at Muza
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="124">especially for</a> this trade, and hatchets and daggers and awls, and various
          kinds of glass; and at some places a little wine, and wheat,
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="125">not for trade, but to</a> serve for getting the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="126">good-will of the savages</a>. There are exported from these places a great
          quantity of <a data-ip-footnote-id="127">ivory</a>, but inferior to that of Adulis, and rhinoceros-horn and
          tortoise-shell (which is in best demand after that from India), and
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="128">a little palm-oil.</a>
          <br />
          <br />
          18. And these markets of Azania are the <a data-ip-footnote-id="129">very last</a> of the continent that
          stretches down on the right hand from <a data-ip-footnote-id="130">Berenice</a>; for beyond these places the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="131">unexplored ocean curves</a> around toward the west, and running along by the
          regions to the
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="132">south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea.</a>

          Chapter 21<br /><br />The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea<br /><br />
          <hr />
          <blockquote>
            A MARINERS’ HANDBOOK FROM the first century AD indicates that although trading vessels from Roman Egypt
            sailed to sub-Saharan Africa, the region offered meagre profits and attracted little interest.
          </blockquote>
          <hr />
          Two thousand years ago the patterns of civilization founded in Athens and Rome radiated across Europe to the
          Rhine and Britain in the north, and to the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula in the west. Trade routes
          carried their influence across Asia to link up with patterns of civilization developing independently in China
          and India. The Mediterranean world was of course entirely under the sway of Rome–including North Africa and
          the resources of the Nile.<br /><br />At that time Rome had a population of close to 1 million people (no
          other city was as large until 1800, when a census recorded 959,310 people living in London) and the
          complexities of everyday life in Rome would not have been unfamiliar to residents of the modern urban world.
          Politics, commerce, religion; architecture, science, art and sculpture; drama and philosophy–there was a lot
          going on. Such large urban communities require a large food supply and must have access to an extensive
          agricultural system, especially grain crops, which are highly productive, relatively easy to transport and
          store for future use.<br /><br />In the decades immediately prior to the birth of Christ the citizens of Rome
          and its immediate environs consumed 320,000 tonnes of corn each year–nearly 1,000 tonnes each day–more than 60
          per cent of which (200,000 tonnes) came by sea from Rome’s North African colonies, and a further 100,000
          tonnes from the cornfields of Egypt alone.<b>[1]</b><br /><br />Rome’s huge and unremitting demand for grain
          was serviced by a minimum of 800 sailings across the Mediterranean each year,<b>[2]</b> in ships with
          capacities of up to 1,000 tonnes and more. The grain freighters were stout ships, built to withstand the worst
          of Mediterranean conditions, with massively strong hulls whose planking was held together by thousands of
          close-set mortise-and-tenon joints, a method of construction known only to Greek and Roman shipwrights.<b
            >[3]</b
          >
          The rig was similarly designed for safety, with a large square sail on a relatively short mainmast.<br /><br />With
          maritime expertise and trade so well developed, it is hardly surprising that Rome’s sphere of activity should
          have extended to include the Nile and Red Sea trade routes following the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC.
          Other seamen had of course sailed these waters for centuries before the Romans achieved domination of the
          region. Arab and Indian seamen regularly sailed back and forth between their two countries on the monsoon
          winds, which blow from the southwest from May to September, then conveniently swing through 180 degrees to
          blow from the northeast from November to April.<br /><br />Eudoxus of Cyzicus is reputed to have sailed from
          Egypt to India and back on the monsoons in 116 BC, a pioneering voyage which initiated a regular flow of Greek
          trade with the subcontinent. But the arrival of the Romans increased the volume of trade throughout the region
          several times over.<br /><br />One hundred and twenty vessels were reported to have sailed for India and
          Arabia from Myos Hormos (a Red Sea port) in a single season around 25 BC, as compared with fewer than twenty
          in earlier times. And the quantities of contemporary Roman coins and pottery found in India are tangible
          evidence of an upsurge in maritime trading enterprise at that time.<b>[4]</b><br /><br />Indeed, within fifty
          years of merchants and shipowners from Roman Egypt entering the Red Sea and Indian Ocean trade, its extent and
          volume had expanded to proportions that merited a handbook of advice concerning routes and ports, giving
          details of the people likely to be encountered, the goods they had to offer, and the wares they would accept
          in exchange. An anonymous Egyptian-born merchant compiled such a handbook sometime between AD 40 and 70 (the
          date is known from the work’s reference to a living monarch who ruled during that period).<br /><br />The
          handbook was entitled Periplus maris Erythraei–a circumnavigation of the Erythraean Sea. ‘Erythraean’
          literally means ‘red sea’, but ancient writers used the term more broadly than is the case today. Their
          Erythraean Sea encompassed not only the modern Red Sea, but also the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea and the
          Indian Ocean, from the western shores of India to the east coast of Africa.<b>[5]</b><br /><br />The author of
          the Periplus was a businessman, not a man of letters. He used a businessman’s Greek: ‘purely functional, flat,
          and styleless, replete with repetitions and studded with technical language and trade terms’.<b>[6] </b>But
          this gives the Periplus a unique status. Unencumbered by gratuitous praise of gods and kings, but full of
          pertinent detail (probably derived from personal observation), the Periplus was an equivalent of the
          modern-day commercial directories that investors consult before embarking on business ventures in foreign
          parts. Then as now, money determined the degree of involvement, and the Periplus is a measure of what the
          world beyond the Red Sea was worth to the merchants and sea-captains of Roman Egypt.<br /><br />Africa appears
          to have been poorly rated. In a work of approximately 7,000 words, the author of the Periplus devotes just
          four paragraphs, 450 words, to the vast regions that lay beyond the Horn of Africa. A number of landmarks are
          listed, a few harbours, and just one port of trade–Rhapta–which is believed to have been in the vicinity of
          present-day Dar es Salaam, though no evidence of the port has ever been found.<br /><br />This lack of
          interest in Africa was probably due to the fact that a return voyage to the East African coast could not be
          equipped and completed within less than two years, while ships could sail to India and back in less than
          twelve months.<br /><br />It was the dog-leg turn around the Horn of Africa and through the Gulf of Aden that
          stretched the time required for the voyage down the East African coast. Although the northeast monsoon enabled
          ships to reach Rhapta within 100 days of leaving Egypt, they were obliged to remain in the region for not less
          than eight months, leaving Rhapta on the last of the southwest monsoon in order to catch the northeast monsoon
          for the westward passage across the Gulf of Aden. It was imperative that their arrival at the Horn of Africa
          coincided with the change of the monsoon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, merchants and investors financing voyages to
          Arabia and India could expect to see a return on their money in little more than a year. Their ships sailed
          down the Red Sea on the end of the northeast monsoon, crossed the Arabian Sea on the rising southwest monsoon
          and returned when it changed to northeast again. And in addition to the advantages of a speedier turnaround,
          India and Arabia had more valuable cargoes to offer than Africa.<br /><br />Ships bound for India filled their
          holds primarily with utilitarian goods for trading in foreign ports–clothing and household items, tools and
          raw materials such as brass, iron, copper, and raw glass–but they returned laden with luxury goods. The
          shippers of Roman Egypt wasted no space in their holds on cheap and mundane goods. They were first and
          foremost dealers in luxuries: frankincense and myrrh from Arabia, and a wealth of highly valued goods from
          India–spices and drugs; diamonds, sapphires, turquoise, lapis lazuli and onyx; pearls and tortoiseshell, fine
          cottons; silks, and even furs trans-shipped from China. Ships returned from India with cargoes of enormous
          value, on which substantial profits were realized–even after the Roman government had taken a 25 per cent
          import duty.<b>[7] </b><br /><br />By contrast, the African trade route, around the Horn of Africa and
          southward along the coast, offered mainly bulky and less valuable items, such as ivory and slaves, some
          rhinoceros horn, tortoiseshell, and a little nautilus shell. Frankincense and myrrh were also on offer, as
          well as cinnamon. Actually, the cinnamon was harvested in India and delivered to East Africa by Arabian ships.
          Indeed, Arabian influence in the region was already paramount. The East African coast was by ‘ancient right’
          under Arabian domination and governed by merchants from present-day Yemen, whose Arabian captains and agents
          were, ‘through continual intercourse and intermarriage… familiar with the area and its language’.<b>[8] </b
          ><br /><br />By virtue of its peripheral status, both geographically and economically, the East African trade
          probably was of interest only to the small-scale merchants of Roman Egyptian trade, who could afford only
          modest supplies of trade goods and chartered cargo-space at bargain rates on lowly freighters. And even their
          trading ventures are a matter of speculation–as yet lacking archaeological confirmation. In India, quantities
          of coin and pottery from the period confirm the presence of Roman Egyptian traders, but none whatsoever have
          been found in East Africa.<br /><br />Although the Periplus is claimed to be of much interest and ‘great value
          for African historiography’,<b>[9] </b> its author saw very little in farthest Africa that was of interest and
          value to Roman Egyptian maritime traders operating out of the Red Sea. He devoted just 6 per cent of the
          Periplus to the region that lay beyond the Horn of Africa. With good reason: it was a bare and desolate
          stretch of coast, sparsely inhabited, offering scant opportunities for profitable trade. Furthermore, all the
          items of merchandise that were available along the coast could also be obtained without leaving the Red Sea at
          all, principally at Adulis, the port through which Meröe exported its produce. And as the fortunes of Meröe
          declined (see pages 192–3), another centre of commerce and political power rose, in the highlands of northern
          Ethiopia–Aksum.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />1. G.E. Rickman,
