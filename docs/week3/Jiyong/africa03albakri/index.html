            This is the independent kingdom of the <a data-ip-footnote-id="[21]">Farwiyyun</a>. Among the strange things
            found there is a pool where water collects and in it a plant grows of which the roots are the surest means
            of strengthening and aiding sexual powers.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="102"
              >The king reserves this for himself and does not allow anyone else to partake of it</a
            >. He owns an <a data-ip-footnote-id="103">enormous number of women</a>, and when he wants to make the round
            of them he warns them one day before, takes the medicine, and then takes them all in turn and scarcely
            flags. One of the neighboring Muslim kings gave him precious gifts requesting some of this plant in
            exchange. In return he gave presents of equal value and wrote a letter saying: “Muslims may lawfully wed
            only a few women,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="104"
              >and I fear that if I sent you this medicine you would not be able to restrain yourself</a

            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[19]">Ghana</a> is a <a data-ip-footnote-id="107">title given to their kings</a>;
            the name of the region is Awkar, and their king today, namely in the year 460,<a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]"
              >[1]</a
            >
            is Tunka Manin. He ascended the throne in 455<a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]">.[2]</a> The name of his
            predecessor was <a data-ip-footnote-id="108"> Basi </a> and he became
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="109">their ruler at the age of 85</a>. He led a praiseworthy life on account of his
            love of justice and <a data-ip-footnote-id="110">friendship for the Muslims</a>. At the end of his life he
            became blind, but he <a data-ip-footnote-id="111">concealed this from his subjects</a>
            and pretended that he could see. When something was put before him he said: “This is good” or “This is bad.”
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="112">His ministers</a> <a data-ip-footnote-id="113"> deceived the people</a> by
            indicating to the king in cryptic words what he should say, so that the commoners could not understand. Basi
            was a maternal uncle of Tunka Manin. This is their custom and their habit, that the kingship is inherited
            only by the son of the <a data-ip-footnote-id="114">king’s sister</a>. He has no doubt that his successor is
            a son of his sister, while he is not certain that his son is in fact his own, and he is not convinced of the
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="115">genuineness of his relationship</a> to him. This Tunka Manin is powerful, rules
            an enormous kingdom, and possesses great authority.<br />

          <a data-ip-footnote-id="116">The city of Ghana</a> consists of two towns situated on a plain<a
            data-ip-footnote-id="[3]"
            >.[3]</a
          >
          One of these towns, which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques, in one of which they
          assemble for the Friday prayer. <a data-ip-footnote-id="117">There are salaried imams and muezzins</a
          ><a data-ip-footnote-id="[4]">,[4]</a> as well as jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet
          water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. The king’s town is six miles distant from
          this one and bears the name of Al-Ghaba<a data-ip-footnote-id="[5]">.[5]</a> Between these two towns there are
          continuous habitations.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="118">The houses of the inhabitants are of stone and acacia wood</a>. The king has a
          palace and a number of domed dwellings all surrounded with an enclosure like a city wall. In the king’s town,
          and not far from his court of justice, is a mosque where the Muslims who arrive at his court pray.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="119"
            >Around the king’s town are domed buildings and groves and thickets where the sorcerers of these people, men
            in charge of the religious cult, live</a
          >. In them too are their idols and the tombs of their kings. These woods are guarded and none may enter them
          and know what is there. In them also are the king’s prisons. If somebody is imprisoned there no news of him is
          ever heard. The king’s <a data-ip-footnote-id="120">interpreters</a>, the official in charge of his treasury
          and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Among the people who follow the king’s religion<a
            data-ip-footnote-id="[6]"
            >[6]</a
          >
          only he and his heir apparent (who is the son of his sister) may wear
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="121">sewn clothes</a>. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade,
          according to their means. All of them shave their beards, and
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="122">women shave their heads.</a>
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="123">The king adorns himself like a woman,</a>
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="124"> wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms</a>, and he puts
          on a high cap decorated with gold and wrapped in a turban of fine cotton. He sits in audience or to hear
          grievances against officials in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses covered with gold-embroidered
          materials. Behind the king stand ten pages holding shields and swords decorated with gold, and on his right
          are the sons of the vassal kings<a data-ip-footnote-id="[7]">[7]</a> of his country wearing splendid garments
          and <a data-ip-footnote-id="125">their hair plaited with gold</a>. The governor of the city sits on the ground
          before the king and around him are ministers seated likewise....
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="126"
            >When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle
            dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by
            clapping their hands.<br /><br
          /></a>
          Their religion is paganism and the worship of idols. When their king dies they construct over the place where
          his tomb will be an enormous dome of wood. Then they bring him on a bed covered with a few carpets and
          cushions and place him beside the dome.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="127"
            >At his side they place his ornaments, his weapons, and the vessels from which he used to eat and drink,
            filled with various kinds of food and beverages.</a
          >
          They place there too the <a data-ip-footnote-id="128">men</a> who used to serve his meals. They close the door
          of the dome and cover it with mats and furnishings. Then the people assemble, who heap earth upon it until it
          becomes like a big hillock and dig a ditch around it until the mound can be reached at only one place.<br /><br />
          They make sacrifices to their dead and make offerings of intoxicating drinks.<br />
          <br />
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="129">
            On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies</a
          >
          one golden dinar<a data-ip-footnote-id="[8]">,[8]</a> and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of
          copper the king’s due is five mithqals<a data-ip-footnote-id="[9]">,[9]</a> and from a load of other goods ten
          mithqals. The best <a data-ip-footnote-id="130">gold</a> found in his land comes from the town of Ghiyaru,
          which is eighteen days’ traveling distant from the king’s town over a country inhabited by tribes of the Sudan
          whose dwellings are continuous.<br />
          <br />
          The <a data-ip-footnote-id="131">nuggets</a> found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king,
          only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="132">it lost its value</a>. The nuggets may weigh from an ounce to a pound. It is
          related that the king owns a nugget as large as a big stone....<br />
          <br />
          The king of Ghana, when he calls up his <a data-ip-footnote-id="133">army</a>, can put 200,000 men<a
            data-ip-footnote-id="[10]"
            >[10]</a
          >
          into the field, more than 40,000 of them <a data-ip-footnote-id="134">archers...</a>.<br />
          <br />
          On the opposite bank of the Nil<a data-ip-footnote-id="[11]">[11]</a> is another great kingdom, stretching a
          distance of more than eight days’ marching, the king of which has the title of Daw. The inhabitants of this
          region use <a data-ip-footnote-id="135">arrows when fighting</a>. Beyond this country lies another called
          Malal<a data-ip-footnote-id="[12]">,[12]</a> the king of which is known as al-musulmani<a
            data-ip-footnote-id="[13]"
            >.[13]</a
          >
          He is thus called because his country became <a data-ip-footnote-id="136">afflicted with drought</a> one year
          following another; the inhabitants prayed for rain, sacrificing cattle till they had exterminated almost all
          of them, but the drought and the misery only increased. The
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="137">king had as his guest a Muslim </a>who used to read the Quran and was acquainted
          with the Sunna<a data-ip-footnote-id="[14]">.[14]</a> To this man the king complained of the calamities that
          assailed him and his people. The man said: “O King, if you believed in God (who is exalted) and testified that
          He is One, and testified as to the prophetic mission of Muhammad (God bless him and give him peace) and if you
          accepted all the religious laws of Islam, I would pray for your deliverance from your
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="138"
            >plight and that God’s mercy would envelop all the people of your country and that your enemies and
            adversaries might envy you on that account.”</a
          >
          Thus he continued to press the king until the latter accepted Islam and became
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="139">a sincere Muslim. </a>The man made him recite from the Quran some easy passages
          and taught him religious obligations and practices which
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="140">no one may be excused from knowing.</a> Then the Muslim made him wait till the
          eve of the following Friday<a data-ip-footnote-id="[15]">,[15]</a> when he ordered him to purify himself by a
          complete ablution, and clothed him in a cotton garment which he had. The two of them came out towards a mound
          of earth, and there the Muslim stood praying while the king, standing at his right side, imitated him. Thus
          they prayed for a part of the night, the Muslim reciting invocations and the king saying “Amen.” The dawn had
          just started to break when God caused abundant rain to descend upon them.
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="141">So the king ordered the idols</a> to be broken and expelled the sorcerers from
          his country. He and his descendants after him as well as his nobles were sincerely attached to
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="142">Islam</a>, while the common people of his kingdom remained
          <a data-ip-footnote-id="143">polytheists.</a> Since then their rulers have been given the title of
          al-musulmani.<br /><br /><br />

          <b>Abū ʿUbayd ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Muḥammad ibn Ayyūb ibn ʿAmr al-Bakrī</b>, or simply Al-Bakri
          (Arabic: أبو عبيد عبدالله بن عبد العزيز البكري‎‎) (c. 1014–1094) was an Andalusian Muslim geographer and
          historian.<br /><br />Al-Bakri was born in Huelva, the son of the sovereign of the short lived principality of
          Huelva. When his father was deposed by al-Mu’tadid he moved to Córdoba where he studied with the geographer
          al-Udri and the historian Ibn Hayyan. He spent his entire life in Al-Andalus, most of it in Seville and
          Almeria. He never travelled to the locations of which he wrote.<br /><br />Al-Bakri wrote about Europe, North
          Africa, and the Arabian peninsula. Only two of his works have survived. His Mu’jam mā ista’jam contains a list
          of place names mostly within the Arabian peninsular with an introduction giving the geographical background.
          His most important work is his Kitāb al-Masālik wa-al-Mamālik (”Book of Highways and of Kingdoms”). This was
          composed in 1068, based on literature and the reports of merchants and travellers, including Muhammad ibn
          Yusuf al-Warraq (904-973) and Abraham ben Jacob.[2][3] It is one of the most important sources for the history
          of West Africa and gives crucial information on the Ghana Empire, the Almoravid dynasty and the trans Saharan
          trade.[3] Although the material borrowed from Yusuf al-Warraq dated from the 10th century, he also included
          information on events that occurred close to the time that he wrote.<br /><br />Al-Bakri mentions the earliest
          urban centers in the trans Saharan trade to embrace Islam, late in the 10th century, Gao was one of the very
          few along the Niger River to have native Muslim inhabitants. Other centres along the serpentine bends of the
          great river eventually followed: Takrur (Senegal); Songhay (Mali); Kanem-Bornu (Chad); and Hausa-territories
          (Nigeria). By the 11th century, reports on these and other flourishing Islamic cities made their way north to
          Al-Andalus in southern Spain, enabling Al-Bakri to write in his Kitab al-Masalik wa al-Mamalik (Book of
          Highways and Kingdoms):<br /><br />“The city of Ghana consists of two towns situated on a plain”, “One of
          these towns, which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques in one of which they
          assemble for the Friday prayer. There are salaried Imams and Muezzins, as well as Jurists and Scholars.”<br /><br />His
          works are noted for the relative objectiveness with which they present information. For each area, he
          describes the people, their customs, as well as the geography, climate and main cities. Similar information
          was also contained in his written geography of the Arabian Peninsula, and in the encyclopedia of the world in
          which he wrote. He also presented various anecdotes about each area. Unfortunately, parts of his main work
          have been lost, and of the surviving parts, some have never been published.<br /><br />“Al-Bakri” from

          <i>Book of Roads and Kingdoms</i> or <i>Book of Highways and Kingdoms</i> (Arabic: كتاب المسالك والممالك,
          Kitāb al-Masālik wa’l-Mamālik‎‎) is the name of an eleventh-century geography text by Abu Abdullah
          al-Bakri.<br /><br />It was written in 1067-8 in Córdoba, al-Andalus (present day Spain). Al-Bakri based his
          work on the accounts of traders, the writings of Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq, (<i
            >On the Topography of North Africa</i
          >), and Abraham ben Jacob. Despite the fact that al-Bakri never left al-Andalus, his writings are regarded as
          objectively reporting the accounts of other travelers by contemporary historians, and much of what he wrote is
          substantiated in other sources.<br /><br />He described a wide array of regions from the Atlantic Ocean,
          through the Sahara, to Central Africa, giving descriptions of the geography, people, culture and political
          situation in each region. The Book of Roads and Kingdoms exists today only in fragmentary form. It is
          sometimes confused with a work by the same name written in the ninth century by ibn Khordadbeh.<br /><br />“<i

          <b>Abu ‘Ubayd al-Bakri</b> (d. 1094 CE)<br /><br />Arab geographer, theologian, poet and lexicographer,
          together with al-Idrisi, one of the two most important representatives of the ‘post-classical’ Arab
          geographical work <i>al-Masalik wa’l-mamalik</i>, a work which, in addition to the sort of basic geographical
          information implied by its title, is distinguished by its author’s methodical approach to a wide variety of
          historical, political and social detail. Although this work no longer survives in its entirety and there are
          difficulties in determining its precise original scope, the sections on west Africa, Spain and eastern Europe
          contain much useful and detailed historical and ethnographic information, and his accounts of the Idrisids and
          origins of the Almoravids remain among the most reliable sources of information on these dynasties. Of
          particular importance is the section on west Africa (<i>bilad al-sudan</i>), which appears to have been widely
          known and used by his successors, probably as a self-standing work; this section remains an important source
          for the history of the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. Al-Bakri’s accont of the Slavs and Russians is
          also of considerable interest.<br /><br />Despite the precision of many of his descriptions, there is no
          evidence that al-Bakri ever undertook any significant travels of his own, and his work appears to rely on a
          combination of oral accounts and works by previous authors, in particular the
          <i>al-Masalik wa’l-Mamalik</i> by Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq, whom he mentions several times.<br /><br />In
          addition to his <i>al-Masalik wa’l-Mamalik</i>, al-Bakri also compiled a work entitled
          <i>Mu’jam ma ‘sta‘jam</i>, an alphabetical listing of place names occuring in Jahili poetry and the prophetic
          <i>hadiths</i>, often accompanied by comments on their etymology and quotations of appropriate verses of
          poetry. The work represents probably the earliest example of its type. Although it had few if any immediate
          successors, it may be regarded as paving the way for later genuine gazetteers such as the
          <i>Mu‘jam al-Buldan</i> of Yaqut al-Hamawi.<br /><br />As well as the two important geographical works
          described previously, al-Bakri is also said to have written a number of works on theology, botany and
          philology, many of which are now lost.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />[Abdurrahman Ali] el-Hajji, [

          /><br /><br /><b>The Ghana Empire</b> (c. 700 until c. 1240), properly known as Awkar (<i>Ghana</i> or
          <i>Ga’a</i> being the title of its ruler) was located in the area of present-day southeastern Mauritania and
          western Mali. Complex societies based on trans-Saharan trade with salt and gold had existed in the region
          since ancient times[1], but the introduction of the camel to the western Sahara in the 3rd century A.D. opened
          the way to great changes in the area that became the Ghana Empire. By the time of the Muslim conquest of North
          Africa in the 7th century the camel had changed the ancient, more irregular trade routes into a trade network
          running from Morocco to the Niger river. The Ghana Empire grew rich from this increased trans-Saharan trade in
          gold and salt, allowing for larger urban centres to develop. The traffic furthermore encouraged territorial
          expansion to gain control over the different trade-routes.<br /><br />When Ghana’s ruling dynasty began
          remains uncertain; it is mentioned for the first time in written records by Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī in
          830. In the 11th century the Cordoban scholar Abuof travelled to the region and gave a detailed description of
          the kingdom. He claimed that the Ghana could "put 200,000 men into the field, more than 40,000 of them
          archers" and noted they had cavalry forces as well.<br /><br />As the empire declined it finally became a
          vassal of the rising Mali Empire at some point in the 13th century. When the Gold Coast in 1957 became the
          first country in sub-Saharan Africa to regain its independence from colonial rule it renamed itself in honor
          of the long-gone empire.<br /><br />“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_Empire" target="_blank"

          <b>(ST)</b> I believe the saying "salt for gold" describes how the king received a highly valuable gift and
          gave something less valuable in return. <br />

          “One day’s travel east of Sila along the Senegal River was the town of Qalanbu, near which lay TRNQH, "a vast
          place" where much cotton cloth was manufactured. To the east of TRNQH was Bambuk, inhabited by the Zafqu and
          Farwiyyun. The Farwiyyun traded gold for salt (Hopkins and Levtzion 1981: 77-79, 456), and though Al-Bakri did
          not suggest the link, one may suppose that the gold thus acquired may have been transported west along the
          Senegal River to Takrur and sold to Godala Berbers. Al-Bakri attributed marvelous happenings to the lands of
          the Zafqu and Farwiyyun. The ruler of the Farwiyyun had exclusive use of the roots of a plant that was
          believed to bequeath incomparable virility, and the Zafqu paid tribute to an enormous serpent that was said to
          inhabit a cave, leaving their offerings at the cave’s mouth where the leaders of the snake cult were believed
          to live.”<br /><br />George E. Brooks,

          In, Glimpes of the Kingdom of Ghana, Al-Bakri described the royal life style in Ghana. The author illustrated
          how the royals dressed and how they spent their time. Furthermore, he portrayed the episode of what affected
          Malal kingdom to convert to Islam. Al-Bakri depicted this in order to show how Islam affected the aristocrats.

          The King adorned himself with jewelry. All men in the royal court shaved beards while women shaved their
          heads. Most kingdoms had polytheistic religion. The constant flow of Muslim travelers and traders helped
          convert these conventional traditions to the Islamic culture, whether the conversions were intentional or not.
          The evidence is shown in the anecdote of Malal kingdom. This region originally had annual droughts but a
          Muslim trader comforted by making rain fall. King of Malal fascinated, abolished the original religion and
          established Islam the area’s religion. [1] <br /><br />[1] Pollard, Elizabeth, Clifford D. Rosenberg, and

          Al-Bakri compiled first-hand experiences of multiple individuals. [2] The information about Ghana and the
          episodes is quite extensive in terms of time and place for the writing to be a first-hand account of the
          writer. The merchants were the people that traded directly with the kingdom, which gives a hint that the
          writings were based from the Muslims’ narratives. <br /><br />[2] "Excerpts Of Letters From Affonso I History

          The active trades allowed Muslim traders to bring Islam to Africa, mostly in Ghana. In the towns of the city
          of Ghana, people who followed king’s religion and Muslims dwelled together. In those towns, Christians and
          Muslims remained religious harmony as they often gathered at mosque for ritual ceremony. However, in another
          kingdom in Ghana, inhabitants abandoned Christianity and became faithful Muslim. It displays the conflict
          between Christianity and Islam in that region.<br /><br />The passage is mostly explaining about Ghana‘s
          customs and religion. In the king’s town, those who follow king’s religion and Muslims came together at mosque
          for ritual ceremony. It shows that in this town, people with different religions often gathered together.
          Especally, this primary source describes cultural aspects of farwiyyun and the king of that empire. It also
          explains how the king of farwiyyun performed and sustained sexual powers and justified those kind of sensitive
          authority.

          Firstly, in a broader aspect, the reasons why there was no significant conflict between Islam and Buddism are
          missing. In the Era that the primary source is discussing about, there were three main religions; Buddism,
          Islam, and Christianity. However, there can be a rising question this resource is not aruguing about Buddism.
          Lastly, in a narrower aspect, we focused on the pattern of the clothes in the empire. Primary source lacks why
          the royal people wore a sewn clothes meanwhile the other people wore a silk clothes known to be luxurious and
          much more expensive textile.

          “Jahanke trade with Senegambia and the Guinea-Bissau region was associated with the spread of Isla, and with
          commerce in cotton textiles ... This chronology is congruent with Al-Bakri’s information, recorded in 1068,
          concerning cloth manufacture in the upper Senegal area and with recent archaeological research that suggests a
          rapid diffusion of cotton growing and textile production between the Nile ND Senegal rivers. The spread of
          Islam in urban areas during the eleventh century was sustained by Arab sources and archaeological data.”
          (68)<br /><br />“Traders were the principal disseminators of Islam, combining their profession with religious
          calling. And depending on their perceived interests, leaders, elites, cultivators, fisherfolk, hunters, and
          others found reason to encourage, disdain, or resist the proselytizing activities of Muslim traders and
          clerics. There were significant advantages in adopting Islamic practices for traders, rulers, and other elites
          in stratified societies and for traders living in acephalous societies ... Drought conditions evidently
          contributed to the spread of Islam during this time. Al Bakri reported the conversion of an unidentified
          Mande-speaking ruler after the prayers of an Arab (guest) ended severe drought, and supposedly the Mande
          leader subsequently destroyed hos ‘fetishes.” (115)

          “Rules concerning the ceremonial submission before the king had to be strictly followed by commoners and
          nobles coming into the royal presence. They had to fall prostrate before the king and place dust and ashes on
          their heads. This custom is recorded by al-Bakri for Ghana, and by Ibn Battuta, al-‘Umari and Ta’rikh
          al-Fattash for Mali.... Sprinkling dust was only a part of a more elaborate procedure of greeting. ‘The farba
          came forward, greeting in the way a king is saluted; that is, he takes off his gown and wraps himself in it.
          He then kneels down, beats his breast and scatters dust over himself.’” (108)<br /><br />[after quoting
          al-Bakri] “The position of Islam in Ghana exemplifies yet another pattern of in the spread of Islam in West
          Africa, that of Muslims who live under the auspices of pagan rulers. The kind of Ghana was interested in
          attracting Muslim traders to the capital, because the prosperity of his kingdom depended on the trans-Saharan
          gold trade. He let the Muslims practice their religion without interference. Both parties, however, preferred
          to live apart. The Muslims were interested in maintaining an autonomous Muslim community, whereas the king
          tried to restrict Islamic foreign influence over his subjects. There were, however, points of contact, and the
          king employed the literate Muslims in his court as interpreters, in the treasury, and whenever a knowledge of
          writing could be of use. Muslims were welcomed, in fact, as long as they did not represent an obvious danger
          to the political system.” (186)<br /><br />“It [the practice of sprinkling dust] was contrary to the Muslim
          concepts of individual dignity, and the obligation to worship none other than Allah. In Ghana, under a pagan
          king, the Muslims were exempted from this practice, and greeted the king by clapping hands only. As al-Bakri
          states explicitly that only those who followed the king’s religion knelt down and sprinkled themselves with
          dust, it appears that the exemption was applied also to Sudanese Muslims, subjects of the king. But it the
          Islamized empire the distinction Muslim and non-Muslim subjects was obliterated and all- excluding North
          African Muslims- had to follow the custom. In other words, as long as Islam stood in opposition to kingship,
          as in Ghana, Muslims were not obliged to perform what the regarded as a pagan custom.” (195)

          “The detailed description of al-Bakri in 1067 show a definite shift from the former “quarantine state of Islam
          to a much deeper penetration of Islam in local life, even in places where the kings did not become Muslim… At
          this stage, whether they adhered to Islam or not, West African kings or their followers were not completely
          converted to Islam, but merely attracted to some aspects of it which they adopted while at the same time
          preserving many of their traditional beliefs and practices.” (92)<br /><br />“1. The Muslims brought the
          economic advantages of long-distance trade… 2. The presence of Muslim scholars was welcome also because they
          provided an important element in the infrastructure of long-distance trade, namely, written communication in
          Arabic, the only international language of West Africa until the introduction of Portuguese on the coast in
          the 15th century and French and English in the 19th century… 5. The kings found Islam a convenient support to
          their imperial authority, since it was a unifying ideology bridging the many tribes and presenting them with a
          wider brotherhood, citizenship or nationality. This produced the phenomenon of “state Islam”, whereby Islam
          was controlled and used to promote the interest of the rulers.” (93, 94)
