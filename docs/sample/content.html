    <div class="title">The Contranst/1792/Which is Best <a>[1]</a></div>
    
    <p>
        War seemed imminent in 1792 Europe. The revolutionary ideals of France began to spread to other countries. Britain’s monarchy was shaky and it had everything to lose by losing ground to the Revolution. Therefore, in a war of ideology, Britain went to war against France. The Contrast leaflet is evidence of the rising liberalist movement in Britain. I will analyze the "The Contrast/Which is Best," in order to place the pamphlet in the historical context.

        The leaflet features two figures, one representing a peaceful Britannia and the other a Medusa-like Marianne. The figure of Britannia wears a full dress with a red cape, but the more noticeable part is her helmet, spear and shield. The whole wardrobe is vaguely reminiscent of Athena, who, in Greek mythology, provides the main tool for Perseus to kill Medusa. Britannia also holds the scales in her left hand, a traditional symbol of justice. She holds the Magna Carta, the constitution of England in her right hand. To Britannia's right, a ship of the line proudly sits in the harbor, flaunting the power of the English navy. A golden lion sits at her feet, a symbol of the British monarchy. <a>[2]</a>

        The slight anomaly in the image is the Phrygian cap at the top of Britannia's trident. For one, the trident is a symbol of Poseidon or Neptune, not Athena. The trident could be attributed to naval power, which England was fiercely proud of. The other is the cap. The Phrygian cap is popularly known as the symbol of the French revolution. However, the symbolism of liberty started much more before the revolution, with its roots in the Roman empire. The trident with the cap can be read as British power under liberty.

    The image of Marianne as Medusa is not as full of symbolism. Medusa, of course, has its roots in Greek mythology. Medusa has hair that is made of snakes, and any mortal who gazes directly upon her head will be turned to stone. Medusa was beheaded by Perseus, but the goddess who was essential to her killing was Athena. She told Perseus that it was only a direct stare that froze mortals into stone, and thus gave Perseus her mirrored shield so Perseus could look upon Medusa without killing himself. Medusa is a symbol of death and menace.  She is standing on a beheaded corpse, with the disembodied head on the tip of her trident. Her dress is tattered, unlike Britannia's. To her right, a dead man hangs from a crossbar. <a>[2]</a>

    The qualities of each Liberty are listed beneath. French Liberty seems to be all things evil personified; “Atheism, Perjury, Rebellion, Treason, Anarchy, Murder, Equality, Madness, Cruelty, Injustice, Treachery, Ingratitude, Idleness, Famine, National & Private Ruin, Misery.” According to this image, France of that time would have been a smoldering wreck. It is odd that equality, today considered a virtue, is listed beneath French Liberty and thus regarded as evil. British Liberty endorses content within a set framework of law and monarchist rule; “Religion, Morality, Loyalty, Obedience to the Laws, Independance <a>[3]</a>, Personal Security, Justice, Inheritance, Protection (of) Property <a>[4]</a>, Industry, National Prosperity, Happiness.” Britain promises security and happiness to those who live with obedience to the laws.

    There are multiple copies of this image throughout the globe. At the British Museum, they house four copies of the Contrast, although one is dated 1793. The 1793 copy is only slightly different from the 1792 copies, suggesting the image was widely used to prove a political point. The dimensions of each copy are approximately 30cm across and 20cm in height, roughly the size of an A4 piece of paper nowadays. The method used to create this image is etching, which, coupled with the dimension of each copy, allows for mass production of the image as pamphlets or leaflets. <a>[5]</a> The copies could have been handed out on street corners to increase awareness or used for propaganda.

    The illustrator is Thomas Rowlandson. Rowlandson grew up in a broken home with average money and he could only attend school because his aunt paid for it. Even though he had promise as an art student, he did not actively pursue that career, preferring to use art primarily to fund his gaming habits. After the death of his aunt, he spent his inheritance on his gambling addiction, traveling through all of Europe to do so. When he eventually ran out of money, he used his skills as an artist to draw caricatures and cartoons. There are a few satirical works attributed to Rowlandson but he was better known for his erotic depictions of the female form. By the early 1800's, Thomas Rowlandson was regarded as one of the leading artists in the British cartoon tradition. <a>[6]</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The distinction of “illustrator” is important because although Rowlandson contributed his artistic skills, others commissioned this work. This particular piece was published on behalf of the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers, after a design by a Lord George Murray. <a>[7]</a> The Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against Republicans and Levellers was a group founded by John Reeves on November 20th, 1792. Since they worked primarily from a tavern called the Crown and Anchor, they were called the Crown and Anchor society. The group's purpose was to "disrupt radical meetings, beat up Paineite printers, initiate prosecutions for sedition and distribute loyalist tracts." <a>[8]</a> The group was very successful in its purpose, and met for the last time in June 1793. The Contrast/Which is Best seems to be part of the loyalist propaganda they distributed.

    Lord George Murray is more elusive to identify. The Murray Clan is an influential Highland Scottish clan with its seat at Blair Castle. There are two Lord George Murrays that are remotely possible. The first Lord George Murray was a Jacobite General who was successful in his campaigns against England. He was a loyalist to the Stuart line of kings(the Jacobite cause) <a>[9]</a> , which may be tied to the loyalist movement under which the Contrast was published. However, the dates are a bit far off. The Lt. Gen Lord Murray lived from 1694 to 1760, a generation before John Reeves or Thomas Rowlandson. Reeves and Rowlandson would have been only 8 and 4 when the Lieutenant General died, respectively.
    </p>

    The other Lord George Murray was a cleric of the Anglican Church and a Bishop of St. David's. The Bishop is known for developing England's first optical telegraph. He lived from 1761 to 1803, which would fit the time frame for the Contrast, but there is no evidence yet linking him to the Crown and Anchor society. <a id="test">[10]</a>

        It is not impossible that a Contrast design by the Lt. Gen George Murray survived and was later reproduced by Reeves and Rowlandson with a mixture of the 1792 circumstances. Lt. Gen Murray lived in the days of Louis XV. Louis XV, le Bien-Aimé (the Beloved) was actually one of the most unpopular kings of France. He entered into the War of Austrian Succession, which pitted the French and Prussians against the Austrians, British, and Dutch. Also the Seven Years' War between France and Britain began in 1756 when the Lt. Gen was still alive. These two conflicts would have created enough British antagonism against France, enough for a design to be created by the Lt. Gen Murray. This mystery of Lord George Murray definitely warrants some more investigation, since his Grace would have been the actual creator of the Contrast image.

    For the purposes of this paper, we will assume that the Contrast was created for the circumstances of 1792. In 1792, France was at the start of its radicalization phase of the Revolution. After the king's flight to Varennes in 1791, the popularity of the once loved Louis XVI was rapidly declining. <a>[11]</a> The absolute powers of Prussia and Austria declared war on France, in the hopes of defending the French Monarchy. The Brunswick Manifesto, written by Louis Joseph de Bourbon (a cousin of Louis XVI), threatened to harm the citizens of Paris if the monarchy was harmed. However, the manifesto enraged the Revolutionary army. <a>[12]</a> After that, the Prussian invasion was stopped at the Battle of Valmy, and "the French were on the offensive." <a>[11]</a> 
    </p>

    This radicalization against a monarchy (which would lead to a republic) did not sit well with the English. Britain by that time had an established constitutional monarchy. The Mad King, George III, reigned during this time and his prime minister was William Pitt the Younger. When the parties sympathetic to the Revolution began to speak of parliamentary reform, Pitt's ministry labeled them as "seditious" and treated them as criminals. Also, Thomas Paine published Rights of Man supporting the demise of the monarchy. The book spread quickly through the public and Pitt would not have wanted anti-monarchist ideas taking roots in the collective psyche. Thus, the Crown and Anchor association was endorsed and semi-employed by the Pitt ministry as a tool for punishing radicals and spreading propaganda such as the Contrast. <a>[8]</a>
    </p>
        
    <p>
    The outlawing of reformist ideas can be considered as "official anxiety about the intellectual social dangers of the revolution." The Pitt ministry was worried that if the revolutionary spirit reached England, it would "jeopardize a fragile consensus in domestic and foreign theaters." <a></a> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In conclusion, the Contrast shows the British anxiety against the expansionist French Revolution, which finally escalated into war. As mentioned above, the Contrast etching made for wide reproduction both because of the method (etching, picture-based) and dimensions (A4 size). Even though the Pitt ministry tried to change the public with these propaganda schemes, the revolutionary ideas were spreading because an idea is not something you can beat out of someone with a stick. In order to protect the monarchy and its ministry, Pitt finally declared war against France.
