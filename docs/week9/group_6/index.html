<h1> <b>Kaiser Wilhelm II, Official Statements on German Colonialism (1901 to 1907)</b> </h6>
  <p> Official Statements of Kaiser Willhelm II on German Colonialism (1901–1907); C. Gauss, <i>The German Kaiser as Shown in His Public Utterances</i> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915), 181-183, scanned by Jerome S. Arkenberg and reprinted by Paul Halsall, May 1998, as part of the <i>Modern History Sourcebook</i>; Johannes Penzler and Bogdan Krieger, eds., <i>Die Reden Kaiser Wilhelms II</i> (Leipzig, 1906-1913), vol. 3, 289, and vol. 4, 62; translated by: Adam Blauhut and reprinted at German History Documents and Images. </p>
  <p> <u>Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany: Speech to the North German Regatta Association (1901)</u> </p>
  <p> In spite of the fact that we have no such fleet as <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]">we should have</a>, we have conquered for ourselves a place in the sun. It will now be my task to see to it that this place in the sun shall remain <a data-ip-footnote-id="[2]">our undisputed possession</a>, in order that the sun's rays may fall fruitfully upon our activity and trade in foreign parts, that our industry and agriculture may develop within the state and our sailing sports upon the water, for our future lies upon the water. The more Germans go out upon the waters, whether it be in races or regattas, whether it be in journeys across the ocean, or in the service of the battle flag, so much the better it will be for us.
    <br />
    For when the German has once learned to direct his glance upon what is distant and great, the pettiness which surrounds him in daily life on all sides will disappear. Whoever wishes to have this larger and freer outlook can find no better place than one of the Hanseatic cities....we are now making efforts to do what, in the old time, the Hanseatic cities could not accomplish, because they lacked the vivifying and protecting power of the empire. May it be the function of my Hansa during many years of peace to protect and advance commerce and trade!
<br />
As head of the Empire I therefore rejoice over every citizen, whether from Hamburg, Bremen, or Lübeck, who goes forth with this large outlook and seeks new points where we can drive in the nail on which to hang our armor. Therefore, I believe that I express the feeling of all your hearts when I recognize gratefully that the director of this company who has placed at our disposal the wonderful ship which bears my daughter's name has gone forth as a courageous servant of the Hansa, in order to make for us friendly conquests whose fruits will be gathered by our descendants! </p>
<p> <u> Reichstag Speech (November 28, 1905) </u> </p>
<p> [ . . . ] The development of our protectorates has been dealt a serious blow by the rebellion in Southwest Africa and, more recently, the unrest in East Africa. The Fatherland has been forced to pay a high price in blood and money. I know that I speak for the German people when I warmly thank and proudly acknowledge the officers and troops who answered my call and defended our territories with heroic courage at risk to their own lives. Their great sacrifices have not been made in vain. The latest dispatches reporting the defeat of the Witboi give us reason to hope that peace and order will be quickly restored in the sorely tried protectorates. Now our goal must be to make the reconquered land profitable again. Efficient transportation routes are vital for the military defense and economic development of our protectorates, and I will be introducing parliamentary bills addressing these matters. The draft budget will propose converting the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office into an Imperial Colonial Office, which will make it easier to cope with the workload of colonial administration. The budget and accounting regulations of the protectorates are currently being simplified, which will provide a basis for colonial self-administration. [ . . . ] </p>
<p> <u> Speech Opening the Reichstag (1907) </u> </p>
<p> [ . . . ] We have overcome the severe crisis that was unleashed in these protectorates by native rebellions in Southwest and East Africa. The revolt in East Africa has been completely suppressed. Except for a few last remnants, the hostile tribes in Southwest Africa have also been defeated, and it will probably be possible to make substantial reductions in the number of troops stationed there. The Fatherland owes its thanks to the brave men who have upheld the glory of the German military in a difficult struggle of many years against a wily, tenacious opponent. [ . . . ] </p>
