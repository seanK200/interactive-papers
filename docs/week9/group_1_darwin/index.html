          <h3>Charles Darwin, <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871)</h3>
<p> Charles Darwin, <i>The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex</i> (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1913), reprinted in Mark A. Kishlansky, ed., Sources of the West (New York: Longman, 2003), 187-189.</p>
<p> The main conclusion arrived at in this work, and now held by many naturalists who are well competent to form a
          sound judgment, <a>is that man is descended from some less highly organised</a> form. The grounds upon which this
          conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close similarity between man and the lower animals in embryonic
          development, as well as in innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of high and of the most
          trifling importance,—the rudiments which he retains, and the abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally
          liable,—are facts which cannot be disputed. They have long been known, but until recently they told us nothing
          with respect <a>to the origin of man</a>. <a>Now when viewed by the light of our knowledge of the whole organic world,
          their meaning is unmistakeable</a>. The great principle of evolution stands up clear and firm, when these groups
          of facts are considered in connection with others, such as the mutual affinities of the members of the same
          group, their geographical distribution in past and present times, and their geological succession. It is
          incredible that all these facts should speak falsely. He who is not content to look, like a savage, at the
          phenomena of nature as disconnected, cannot any longer believe that man is the work of a separate act of
          creation. <a>He will be forced to admit</a> that the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that, for instance, of
          a dog—the construction of his skull, limbs, and whole frame, independently of the uses to which the parts may
          be put … —all point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other mammals
          of a common progenitor… <br /> </p>
          <p>
            Through the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet undiscovered, man has been raised to his
            present state. But since he attained to the rank of manhood, he has <a>diverged into distinct races</a>, or as they
            may be more appropriately called <a>sub-species</a>. Some of these, for instance the Negro and European, are so
            distinct that, if specimens had been <a>brought to a naturalist</a> without any further information, <a>they would
            undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species. </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless all the races agree in so many unimportant details of structure and in so many <a>mental
            peculiarities</a>, that these can be accounted for only through inheritance from a common progenitor; and a
            progenitor thus characterised would probably have deserved to <a>rank as man</a>…
          </p>
          <p>
            By considering the embryological structure of man, —the homologies which he presents with the lower
            animals,—the rudiments which he retains,—and the reversions to which he is liable, we can partly recall in
            imagination the former condition of our early progenitors; and can approximately place them in their proper
            position in the zoological series. We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished
            with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its habits, and <a>an inhabitant of the Old World</a>. This
            creature, if its whole structure had been examined by a naturalist, would have been classed amongst the
            Quadrumana, as surely as would the common and still more ancient progenitor of the Old and New World
            monkeys. The Quadrumana and all the higher mammals are probably derived from an ancient marsupial animal,
            and this through a long line of diversified forms, either from some reptile-like or some amphibian-like
            creature, and this again from some fish-like animal. In the dim obscurity of the past we can see that the
            early progenitor of all the Vertebrata must have been an aquatic animal, provided with branchiæ, with the
            two sexes united in the same individual, and with the most important organs of the body (such as the brain
            and heart) imperfectly developed. This animal seems to have been more like the larvæ of our existing marine
            Ascidians than any other known form.
          </p>
          <p>
            The high standard of intellectual power and of moral disposition is the greatest difficulty which presents
            itself, after we have been driven to this conclusion on the origin of man. But every one who admits the
            general principle of evolution, must see that the mental powers of the higher animals, which are the same in
            kind with those of man, though so different in degree, are capable of advancement. Thus the interval between
            the mental powers of one of the higher apes and of a fish, or between those of an ant and scale-insect, is
            immense; yet the development of these powers in animals does not offer any special difficulty; for with our
            domesticated animals, the mental faculties are certainly variable, and the variations are inherited. No one
            doubts that these faculties are of the utmost importance to animals in a state of nature. <a data-ip-footnote-id="(SU1)">Therefore the
            conditions are favourable for their development through natural selection. The same conclusion may be
            extended to man; the intellect must have been all-important to him</a>, even at a very remote period, enabling
            him to use language, to invent and make weapons, tools, traps, &c.; whereby with the aid of his social
            habits, he long ago became the most dominant of all living creatures…
          </p>
          <p>
            The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but <a>the most complete of all the
            distinctions</a> between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that
            this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading <a>spiritual agencies</a>
            seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in the reasoning powers of man,
            and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the
            assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this
            is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant
            spirits, possessing only a little more power than man; for the belief in them is far more general than of a
            beneficent Deity. <a>The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator of the universe does not seem to arise in
            the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long continued culture…</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          I am aware that the conclusions arrived at in this work will be denounced by some as highly irreligious; but
          he who thus denounces them is bound to shew why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man as a
          distinct species by descent from some lower form, through the laws of variation and natural selection, than to
          explain the birth of the individual through the laws of ordinary reproduction. The birth both of the species
          and of the individual are equally parts of that grand sequence of events, which our minds refuse to accept as
          the result of blind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether or not we are able to
          believe that every slight variation of structure,— the union of each pair in marriage,—the dissemination of
          each seed,—and other such events, have all been ordained for some special purpose… <p/>
          The main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely that man is descended from some lowly-organised form,
          will, I regret to think, be highly distasteful to many persons. But there can hardly be a doubt that we are
          descended from barbarians. The astonishment which I felt on first seeing a party of <a>Fuegians</a> on a wild and
          broken shore will never be forgotten by me, for the reflection at once rushed into my mind— such were our
          ancestors. These men were absolutely naked and bedaubed with paint, their long hair was tangled, their mouths
          frothed with excitement, and their expression was wild, startled, and distrustful. They possessed hardly any
          arts, and like wild animals lived on what they could catch; they had no <a>government</a>, and were merciless to
          every one not of their own small tribe. He who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame,
          if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more humble creature flows in his veins. For my own part I
          would as soon be descended from that heroic little monkey, who braved his dreaded enemy in order to save the
          life of his keeper; or from that old baboon, who, descending from the mountains, carried away in triumph his
          young comrade from a crowd of astonished dogs—<a>as from a savage</a> who delights to torture his enemies, offers up
          bloody sacrifices, practises infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no decency, and
          is haunted by the grossest superstitions. </p>
          Man may be excused for feeling some pride at having risen, though
          not through his own exertions, to the very summit of the organic scale; and the fact of his having thus risen,
          instead of having been aboriginally placed there, may give him hopes for a still higher destiny in the distant
          future. But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only with the truth as far as our reason allows us
          to discover it. I have given the evidence to the best of my ability; and we must acknowledge, as it seems to
          me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence
          which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has
          penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man still
          bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.
