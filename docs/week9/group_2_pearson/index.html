          <p>
            How many centuries, how many thousand of years, have the Kaffir or the Negro held large districts in Africa
            undisturbed by the white man? Yet their intertribal struggles have not yet produced a civilization in the
            least comparable with the Aryan. Educate and nurture them as you will,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="believe">I do not believe that you will succeed in modifying the stock</a>. History
            shows me one way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the
            struggle of race with race, and the
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="survival"> survival of the physically and mentally fitter race</a>. If you want to
            know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to
            fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual,
            between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="climate">climate</a> on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            If you bring the white man into contact with the black, you too often suspend the very process of
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="natural">natural selection</a> on which the evolution of a higher type depends. You
            get superior and inferior races living on the same soil, and that coexistence is
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="demor">demoralizing for both</a>. They naturally sink into the position of
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="master">master and servant</a>, if not admittedly or covertly into that of
            slave-owner and slave. Frequently they intercross, and if the bad stock be raised the good is lowered. Even
            in the case of <a>Eurasians</a>, of whom I have met mentally and physically fine specimens, I have felt how
            much better they would have been had they been <a>pure</a> Asiatics or pure Europeans. Thus it comes about
            that when the struggle for existence between races is suspended, the solution of great problems may be
            unnaturally postponed; instead of the slow, stern processes of evolution, cataclysmal solutions are prepared
            for the future. Such problems in suspense, it appears to me, are to be found in the negro population of the
            Southern States of America, in the large admixture of Indian blood in some of the South American races, but,
            above all,
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            You may possibly think that I am straying from my subject, but I want to justify <a>natural selection</a> to
            you. I want you to see selection as something which renders the inexorable law of heredity a source of
            progress which produces <a>the good through suffering</a>, an infinitely greater good which far outbalances
            the very obvious pain and evil. Let us suppose the alternative were possible. Let us suppose we could
            prevent the white man, if we liked, from going to lands of which the agricultural and mineral resources are
            not worked to the full; then I should say a thousand times better for him that he should not go than that he
            should settle down and live alongside the <a>inferior race</a>. The only <a>healthy</a> alternative is that
            he should go and completely drive out the inferior race. That is practically what the white man has done in
            North America. …The civilization of the white man is a civilization dependent upon free white labour, and
            when that element of stability is removed
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="collapse">it will collapse like those of Greece and Rome</a>. I venture to assert,
            then, that the struggle for existence between white and red man, painful and even terrible as it was in its
            details, has given us a good far outbalancing its immediate evil. In place of the red man,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="contributing">contributing practically nothing</a> to the work and thought of the
            world, we have a great nation, mistress of many arts, and able, with its youthful imagination and fresh,
            untrammelled impulses, to contribute much to the common stock of civilized man. Against that we have only to
            put the romantic sympathy for the Red Indian generated by the novels of Cooper4 and the poems of Longfellow,
            and then see how little it weighs in the balance!...
            <br />
            <br />
            You will see that my view—and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation—is that of an
            organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are
            substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by
            insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of
            external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="blueberries">war with inferior races, and with equal races</a> by the struggle for
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="raspberries">trade</a>-routes and for the sources of raw material and of food
            supply. This is the natural history view of mankind, and I do not think you can in its main features subvert
            it. Some of you may realize it, and then despair of life; you may decline to admit any glory in a world
            where the superior race must either eject the inferior, or, mixing with it, or even living alongside it,
            degenerate itself. What beauty can there be when the battle is to the stronger,
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="flummox">
              and the weaker must suffer in the struggle of nations and in the struggle of individual men?</a
            >
            You may say: Let us cease to struggle; let us leave the lands of the world to the races that cannot profit
            by them to the full; let us cease to compete in the markets of the world. Well, we could do it, if we were a
            small nation living on the produce of our own soil, and a soil so worthless that no other race envied it and
            sought to appropriate it.
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="petrichor">We should cease to advance</a>; but then we should naturally give up
            progress as a good which comes through suffering. I say it is impossible for a small rural community to
            stand apart from the world-contest and to stagnate, if no more powerful nation wants its possessions.

          environment that surrounds the races. Considering the massive difference in environment, it would be
          practically impossible for Africans to achieve the success of the Europeans, judging the lack of farm land.
          Did the author deliberately ignore this fact?

          to justify their superiority and war. However, were they this desperate for a boost in self-esteem that they
          use natural selection, a concept that cannot be applied to the human race since no race has been extinct by
          the environment?
