            Edgar Rice Burroughs, <a data-ip-footnote-id="[1]">Tarzan of the Apes (1914)</a>, excerpts from chapter 9,
            “Man and Man”
          </h3>

          <p>
            Tarzan of the Apes lived on in his wild, jungle existence with little change for several years, only that he
            grew stronger and wiser, and learned from <a>his books</a> more and more of the strange worlds which lay
            somewhere outside his primeval forest.
          </p>

          <p>
            To him life was never monotonous or stale. There was always Pisah, <a>the fish</a>, to be caught in the many
            streams and the little lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on the alert and give
            zest to every instant that one spent upon the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them, but though they never quite reached him with those
            cruel, sharp claws of theirs, yet there were times when one could scarce have passed a thick leaf between
            their talons and his smooth hide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick was <a>Sabor</a>, the lioness, and quick were Numa and Sheeta, but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends. How? Ask not. But this is known to the denizens of the jungle,
            that on many moonlight nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the elephant, walked together, and where the
            way was clear Tarzan rode, perched high upon Tantor’s mighty back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of
            his parents and the skeleton of Kala’s baby.
            <a
              >At eighteen he read fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes on the
              shelves.</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Also could he write</a>, with printed letters, rapidly and plainly, but script he had not mastered, for
            though there were several copy books among his treasure, there was so little written English in the cabin
            that he saw no use for bothering with this other form of writing, though he could read it, laboriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could speak no English, and yet who could
            <a>read and write his native language</a>. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for the
            little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no greater river to bring down the
            <a
              data-ip-footnote-id="[Video on Africans and Europeans. Note how Europeans are viewed as the 'civilizers' here.]"
              >savage natives</a
            >
            of the interior.
          </p>
          <p>
            High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the fourth. It was alive with lions and leopards and
            poisonous snakes. Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited no hardy pioneer from the human
            beasts beyond its frontier.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book,
            <a>the ancient security of his jungle</a> was broken forever.
          </p>
          <p>At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in single file, over the brow of a low hill.</p>
          <p>
            In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires,
            and long bows and poisoned arrows. On their backs were oval shields, in their noses huge rings, while from
            the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across their foreheads were tattooed <a>three</a> parallel lines of color, and on each breast three
            concentric circles. Their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great protruding lips added
            still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following them were several hundred women and children, the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of
            cooking pots, household utensils and ivory. In the rear were a hundred warriors, similar in all respects to
            the advance guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance
            was evidenced by the formation of the column; and such was the fact, for they were fleeing from the white
            man’s soldiers who had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors one
            day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of his black troops.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many days they had gorged themselves on meat, but eventually a stronger body of troops had come and
            fallen upon their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            That night the black soldiers of the white man had had <a>meat a-plenty</a>, and this little remnant of a
            once powerful tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the unknown, and freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these
            <a data-ip-footnote-id="[A contemporary video about the lifestyle of African tribe people]"
              >savage blacks</a
            >
            meant consternation and death to many of the wild denizens of their new home.
          </p>
          <p>
            For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the heart of this unknown and untracked forest,
            until finally, early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river, which
            seemed less thickly overgrown than any ground they had yet encountered.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Here they set to work to build a new village</a>, and in a month a great clearing had been made, huts and
            palisades erected, plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had taken up their old life in their new
            home. Here there were no white men, no soldiers, nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for
            <a>cruel and thankless taskmasters</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the territory surrounding their new village.
            Several had already fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so infested with these fierce and
            bloodthirsty cats, and with lions and leopards, the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves far from
            the safety of their palisades.
          </p>
          <p>
            But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga, wandered far into the dense mazes to the west. Warily
            he stepped, his slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield firmly grasped in his left hand close to his
            sleek ebony body.
          </p>
          <p>
            At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield many slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the
            thick, dark, tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father’s village, but still headed westward, and climbing
            into the fork of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself for sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three miles to the west slept the tribe of Kerchak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving through the jungle in search of food. Tarzan, as was his
            custom, prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely hunting on the way his
            stomach was filled by the time he reached the beach.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apes scattered by ones, and twos, and threes in all directions, but ever within sound of a signal of
            alarm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east, and was busily engaged in turning over rotted
            limbs and logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi, when the faintest shadow of a strange noise brought
            her to startled attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing
            figure of a strange and fearful creature.
          </p>
          <p>It was Kulonga.</p>
          <p>
            Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly back along the trail. She did not run; but, after
            the manner of her kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Close after her came Kulonga. Here was meat. He could make a killing and feast well this day. On he hurried,
            his spear poised for the throw.
          </p>
          <p>
            All day <a>Tarzan followed Kulonga</a>, hovering above him in the trees like some <a>malign spirit</a>.
            Twice more he saw him hurl his arrows of destruction—once at Dango, the hyena, and again at Manu, the
            monkey. In each instance the animal died almost instantly, for Kulonga’s poison was very fresh and very
            deadly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind
            his quarry. He knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly dispatch these wild things
            of the jungle, who were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with their
            jungle neighbors, yet as often recovered as not.
          </p>
          <p>
            No, there was something mysterious connected with these tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a
            mere scratch. He must look into the matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            That night Kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree and far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared. The black warrior was furious and
            frightened, but more frightened than furious. He searched the ground below the tree, and he searched the
            tree above the ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kulonga was panic-stricken. His spear he had hurled at Kala and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and
            arrows were gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife. His only hope lay in reaching the village of
            Mbonga as quickly as his legs would carry him.
          </p>
          <p>
            That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took the trail at a rapid trot.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in
            his wake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kulonga’s bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had
            been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty
            feet higher up. Thus Tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed on him until he traveled almost over the black’s head. His
            rope he now held coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for the kill.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment was delayed only because Tarzan was anxious to ascertain the black warrior’s destination, and
            presently he was rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing, at one end of which lay many
            strange lairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery. The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two
            hundred yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but Tarzan’s life training left so little space between
            decision and action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even room for the shadow of a
            thought between.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above
            him from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of Mbonga, and ere the
            king’s son had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that Kulonga’s cry of alarm was throttled in his
            windpipe. Hand over hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by his neck in mid-air;
            then Tarzan climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering
            verdure of the tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch, and then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into
            Kulonga’s heart. <a>Kala was avenged.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarzan examined the black minutely, for he had never seen any other human being. The knife with its sheath
            and belt caught his eye; he appropriated them. A copper anklet also took his fancy, and this he transferred
            to his own leg.
          </p>
          <p>
            He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast. He marveled at the
            <a>sharp filed teeth.</a> He investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress, and then he prepared to
            get down to business, for Tarzan of the Apes was hungry, and here was meat; meat of the kill, which
            <a>jungle ethics</a> permitted him to eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man with the heart and head and body of an English
            gentleman, and the training of a wild beast?
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Tublat</a>, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he had killed in a fair fight, and yet never had the
            thought of eating Tublat’s flesh entered his head. It could have been as revolting to him as is cannibalism
            to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer? Was he not
            simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the
            cravings of hunger?
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a strange doubt stayed his hand. Had not his books taught him that he was a man? And was not The
            Archer a man, also?
          </p>
          <p>
            Did <a>men eat men</a>? Alas, he did not know. Why, then, this hesitancy! Once more he essayed the effort,
            but <a>a qualm of nausea</a> overwhelmed him. He did not understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black man, and thus <a>hereditary instinct</a>, ages
            old, usurped the functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a worldwide law of
            <a>whose very existence he was ignorant.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quickly he lowered Kulonga’s body to the ground, <a>removed the noose</a>, and took to the trees again.

          <b>(C)</b> In the author's mind, was Tarzan's ability to read or write though he was raised without other
          humans around a result of his own genius or evolution? That is because his ancestors had acquired these skills
          in order to survive was it something he was born with?

          <b>(SU)</b> It's surprising to see that the security of the jungle Tarzan lived in was so remote that he
          hadn't encountered any humans up until that point, something unlikely to be observed nowadays.
