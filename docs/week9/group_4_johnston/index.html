          <h2><a>Sir Harry Johnston</a>, <i>The Backward Peoples and Our Relations With Them (1920)</i></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Sir Harry Johnston, <i>The Backward Peoples and Our Relations with Them</i>(1920); From Sir Harry Johnston,
          <i>The Backward Peoples and Our Relations with Them</i> (London: Oxford University Press, 1920), 79, reprinted
          in Perry M. Rogers, ed., <i>Aspects of Western Civilization: Problems and Sources in History</i> (Englewood
          Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1988), 210-212. <br />
          <br />
          [L]et us proceed to define who and what these <a>backward or unprogressive peoples</a> are and to what extent
          they may be considered to be <a>retrograde</a> and ineffective as compared with the dominating white race. The
          chief and obvious distinction between the backward and forward peoples is that the former, with the exception
          of about 20,000,000 in the Mediterranean basin and the Near East, are of coloured skin; while the latter are
          white-skinned, or, as in the case of <a>Japanese</a> and the inhabitants of Northern China, nearly white.
          <br />
          <br />
          I think if we took all the factors into consideration – religion, education (especially knowledge concerning
          the relations between this planet and the universe of which it is a minute speck, the history and geography of
          the planet, the sciences that are a part of earth-study), standard of living, respect for sanitation, infant
          death rate, bodily strength, manner of government, regard for law and order, position in agriculture and
          manufactures, –
          <a

            which humanity is divided:</a

            This rough estimate of civilization and culture does not imply that the nations or peoples which are classed
            together resemble one another in all their stages of culture. Some will excel in one direction, some in
            another. In certain directions a people may be very forward, coupled with retrogra features which reduce
            their <a>average value.</a>

          <b>(AUTH)</b> Why does the author refer to them as backward people? It is quite a weak term compared to the other terms that were used by people that believe in human evolution to describe Africans.

          <b>(SU)</b> It is interesting how the author presents these people to go in the exact opposite direction of his people by using this term.

          <b>(C)</b> The Japanese could have been included as a result of the Russo-Japanese war that happened earlier, and the author may have wanted to justify the Russian defeat.
<br /><br />
Judging from Japan in 100 percent (1st) group and Russia in 97 percent (3rd) group, I agree with this comment--this document is highly affected by the international politics, not exactly scientific

          <p>
          <b>(ST)</b> The author uses somewhat 'scientific' approach, but this only implies & justifies the hierarchy between nations.
        </p>
          <b>(M)</b> A reasonable explanation for calculating such percentage should have been involved

          <b>(SU)</b> This method makes the different "directions" of a culture mostly irrelevant. The purpose of such a general measurement(?) is unclear to me.

        </div>

        <div class="footnote hide-id" id="Obviously, the foremost nations in the world at the present day are Britain">
          <b>(AUTH)</b> this reflects the author's worldview

        <div class="footnote hide-id" id="but by their industry">
          <b>(A)</b> The reason why the author ranks the British Empire, Germany, the United States & France above historically significant empires in Europe like Spain, Portugal appears to be rooted in the nations involvement with industrialization.
