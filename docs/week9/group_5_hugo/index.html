          </p>
          <p>
            It has been a joy for me to be able to shake the hands of so many distinguished men who have left a good
            memory in the <a>memorable human liberation that we celebrate today</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sirs, the current moment will be remembered in this century. It’s a point of arrival, it’s a point of
            departure. It has its physiognomy: in the north, despotism, in the south, liberty; in the north, the storm,
            in the south, peace. As for ourselves, since we are simply seekers of truth, since we are dreamers, writers,
            attentive philosophers; since we are gathered here around a single idea, the <a>improvement</a> of the human
            race; since we are, in one word, passionate men occupied with this <a>great subject</a>—<a>man</a>—let us
            take advantage of this meeting, let us fix our eyes on the future; let us ask ourselves what the twentieth
            century will bring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Politically, you feel it, I do not need <a>to tell you</a>. <a>Geographically</a>,-- allow me to limit
            myself with this designation—the destiny of men is in the south.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment has come to give the old world this warning: you must become a new world. The moment has come to
            make Europe notice that she has Africa at her side. The moment has come to tell <a>the four nations</a> from
            which modern history emerged—Greece, Italy, Spain, <a>France</a>—that they are still there, that their
            mission has been modified without being transformed, that they are still in the same position of sovereign
            authority on the shores of the Mediterranean, and that, if we add to them a fifth people, those who were
            interpolated by Virgil and who showed themselves worthy of his regard, England, we have, nearly, all the
            effort of the human race of antiquity towards work, which is progress, and towards unity, which is life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mediterranean is a lake of civilization; it is certainly not for nothing that the Mediterranean has on
            its shores the old universe and the other ignored universe, that is to say, on one side all civilization and
            on the other all <a>barbarism</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The moment has come to say to this illustrious group of nations: <a>Unite! Go southward</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Do you not see the barrier? It is there, in front of you, this block of sand and cinders, this inert and
            passive hodgepodge, that, for six thousand years, has been an obstacle for the universal march, this
            monstrous <a>Cham that stops Sem</a> with its enormity—<a>Africa</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What a land is Africa! Asia has its history, America has its history, even Australia has its history;
            <a>Africa has no history</a>. A sort of vast and obscure legend envelopes it. Rome touched it, in order to
            suppress it; and, when it believed itself to be delivered from Africa, Rome threw on this immense death, one
            of these epithets that cannot be translated: Africa portentosa! (Applause) It’s more and less than the feat.
            It is what is absolute in the horror. The tropical flaming, in effect, it is Africa. It seems that to see
            Africa, one must be blind. An excess of sun is an excess of night.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed, <a>this fear</a> must disappear.</p>
          <p>
            Already the two colonizing peoples, who are the two great free peoples, France and England, have seized
            Africa; France holds it by the west and by the north; England holds it by the east and the center. Here
            Italy accepts its part of this colossal work. America joins its efforts to ours; because the unity of
            peoples is revealed in everything. Africa matters to the universe. Such a suppression of the movement and
            circulation hinders universal life, and the human march cannot accommodate itself any longer to a fifth of
            the globe being paralyzed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sturdy pioneers have risked it, and, from their first steps, this strange soil has appeared real; these
            lunar landscapes have become terrestrial landscapes. France is ready to bring a sea there. This wild Africa
            has only two faces: populated, it is barbarism; deserted, it is savagery; but it no longer is evasive; the
            places reputed to be inhabitable are possible climates;
            <a
              >one finds everywhere navigable rivers; forests rise, vast branches encumber here and there, the horizon;
              what will be the attitude of civilization in front of this unknown flora and fauna</a
            >? Lakes have appeared, who knows? Maybe [it is] this sea Nagain of which the Bible speaks. Gigantic
            hydraulic apparatuses are prepared by nature and await man; one sees the spots where cities are born; one
            images the communications; mountain ranges are drawn; peaks, passes, straights are passable: this universe
            that frightened the Romans, attracts the French.
          </p>
          Notice with what majesty great things are accomplished. Obstacles exist, as I have already said, they do their
          duty, which is to be conquered. This is not without difficulty. In the north, I insisted, a movement is being
          undertaken the divide ut regnes executes a colossal effort, the supreme monarchical powers create it. The
          German empire unites with all of its power against all that it supposes to be the modern spirit; the Muscovite
          empire offers an even more moving picture. To authority without limit, resists something that also has no
          limit; the omnipotent despotism that a million men give to one individual who cries: I want everything, I take
          everything! I have everything!—the abyss makes this terrible response: Nihil. And today we assist in the
          terrifying struggle between Nothing with Everything. (Enthusiastic applause) Spectacle worthy of meditation!
          Nothing engenders chaos. The social question has never been posed in such a tragic fashion, but rage is not a
          solution. Also, we hope that the vast breath of the 19th century will be felt as far as these distant regions,
          and will substitute bellicose convulsions with pacifist resolutions. However, if the north is worrisome, the
          center is reassuring. To the south, a close tie grows and strengthens between France, Italy and Spain. At
          heart, we are essentially the same people, and Greece is added to that, because the Latin origins suppose a
          Greek origin. These nations have the Mediterranean, and England greatly needs the Mediterranean to separate
          themselves from the four people who are its masters. Already the United States of the South sketch a draft of
          the United States of Europe. (Bravos) No hatred, no violence, no anger.
          <a>This is the great peaceful march towards harmony, fraternity and peace.</a>
          <p>
            To the popular acts should be added the acts of humans; the definitive form can be seen; the gigantic group
            can be divined; and, in order not to pass over the limits that you have set out for yourselves, in order to
            stay with in the order of things where it is agreed that I will remain, I limit myself, and this will be my
            final word, to note this detail, which is only a detail, but which is immense: in the nineteenth century,
            the white has made of the black a man; in the twentieth century,
            <a>Europe will make of Africa a world. (Applause.)</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            Refashion a new Africa, remake old Africa ready for civilization, such is the problem. Europe will resolve
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Go, peoples! Seize this land.Take it! For whom? For nobody. Take this land for God. God gave the earth to
            men, <a>God offered Africa to Europe.</a> Take it. Where the kings would bring war, bring peace.
            <a
              >Take it, not for the cannon, but for the plough; not for the sword, but for trade; not for battles, but
              for industry; not for conquest, but for fraternity.</a
            >
            (Prolonged applause.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Pour your excess energy in this Africa, and at the same time resolve your social questions, change your
            proletariat into property-owners. Go, do it! Make roads, make ports, make cities; grow, cultivate, colonize,
            multiply; and that, on this earth, [which is] more and more disengaged from priests and from princes, the
            divine Spirit asserts itself with peace and the human Spirit with liberty!
          </p>
          (This speech, constantly interrupted with enthusiastic applause, was followed by an explosion of shouts of
          “Long live Hugo! Long live the Republic!”)

          <b>(NAT)</b> The purpose of this speech is to praise European countries, like France, England, and Italy, for
          colonizing parts of Africa. This speech was held before the "scramble for Africa," so this public stage, and
          possibly others, could've been a catalyst to the rush of African colonization. Victor includes prideful
          diction that could've provoked other European nations to follow France and England in suit.

          <b>(AUTH)</b> This fear, aforementioned in other documents suggesting that it was a provoker for colonialism,
