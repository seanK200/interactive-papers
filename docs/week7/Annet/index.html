          About ten days after the defendant gave me <a>two cloths</a> and told me that he had given me in marriage to
          one of his house people, and I remonstrated with defendant. I asked him how it was (that when I had been left
          by Yowawhah to live with him, and that he would return), that he had given me in marriage to one of his
          people. On this I thought that I had been sold and <a>I ran away</a>. At the time the defendant said he had
          given me in marriage to Tandoe. And the defendant said that if I did not consent to be married to Tandoe he
          would tie me up and flog me. I heard I had country people living at Cape Coast, and for what the defendant
          said I ran away and came to Cape Coast.
          <br />
          <br />
          The defendant’s sister said to me “You have taken some cloths to go and wash for some person, but will you not
          cook for your mother.” I thought on this that I had been purchased. That also <a>induced me to run away.</a>
          <br />

          On the evening as your master took you to the defendant did he say to you “I shall not take away the cloths on
          your person because <a>I have known your body</a>, but I will <a>cut my beads</a> and did he not cut the
          beads?
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The form of the question is objected to by Mr. Brew on behalf of the defendant.

          When my master finished buying what he wanted to buy; I carried some of the goods and went with him to his
          lodgings, and in the evening he handed me to the defendant and said
          <a>“I should live with the defendant until he returned” that was what he said to me</a>. And after that l
          thought on what the defendant's sister said to me and I made up my mind to run away as I heard that my country
          people lived in Cape Coast.
