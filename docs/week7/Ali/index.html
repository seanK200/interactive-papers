          <b>(C)</b> <b>(SU)</b> After the British empire defeated the Asanti in 1874 with help from local allies, the
          bulk of the region become self-governing protectorates. But they had to obey certain orders from the British,
          e.g. abolishing slavery. It is notable that slavery in this region was run by the locals, and the British
          championed freedom.

          <b>(NAT)</b> The nature of the source eliminates any personal opinion of the transcriber, giving relatively
          objective information. <br /><b>(C)</b> Isn't court itself a European custom? The situation of an African
          having to defend oneself in a European court itself could have been a demerit.

          <b>(AUTH)</b> Considering that the judge and the prosecutors are English, it is safe to assume that the
          English had influence in this region. Then, was it normal for the English to record court transcripts even in
          cases in Africa?
