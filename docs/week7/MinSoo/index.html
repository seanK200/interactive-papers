          <b>(C) (ST)</b> There were four ways Hutton could have vindicated his client, Eddoo. 1. Making the presiding
          judge believe she was Eddo's wife. 2. Eddo's daughter. 3. Eddo's apprentice. 4. Eddoo was unaware of the 1874
          ordinance. Here, Hutton is trying to make it look like that she rendered services in exchange for board and
          lodging, and that she was not a slave, if not a wife or daughter.
          <br />
          <b>(C)</b> The questioner has a preconceived notion that she didn't think she was a slave by herself; someone
          made her think of it (as if an individual can't feel the difference between freedom and no freedom)

          <b>(Q)</b> Was she really considered a slave, or were women already somehow discriminated against in that
          particular area? Could her being called "slave" be a derogatory jeer?
