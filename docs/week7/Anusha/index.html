            <b>PROSECUTOR DAVIS</b> What is read to you now did you not make that statement? <br />
            <b>ABlNA MANSAH</b> I did make that statement. But two persons called Attah and Sanygar of defendant's house
            said to me that <a>if I did not consent to be married to Tandoe</a> and
            <a>live with him they would tie me and flog me</a>. I do not know whether it was the defendant that said so
            or not. <a>[2]</a> <br />

            Eddoo was it false? <br />

          purpose of these marriages? Was it solely for reproduction & forming a family?

          <b>(C)</b> She addresses the threat of being flogged causally as if it happens quite often to her. Was it
          legal? If it was legal it means that people could do anything to their slaves. But, if that is the case why
          even have a court session about her misconduct. If property was that much valued, why not give the slave back
          to the owner and not have a court case?
