          <b>The Gold Coast, ca. 1876 (99-103)</b><br/><br/>The Gold Coast is a name bestowed by Europeans upon a stretch of West Africa roughly approximating the southern half of the modern-day state of Ghana. The name derives from the fact that from the eighth to the sixteenth centuries (and even today) the inhabitants of the region extracted a great deal of gold that entered the world economy, first by crossing the Sahara Desert into North Africa, and later, through trade with European merchants who visited the coast. In fact, gold was only one of many materials in this region’s history produced by the hard work of its people and from its rich soil and desired by the outside world. Over the past millennium, foreigners have often come seeking their wealth from the soil and people of the Gold Coast, whether by trading in gold, kola nuts, palm oil, or cocoa.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

          <b>EARLY HISTORY (99-101)</b> The human presence in West Africa stretches back many thousands of years, but for most of that period the Gold Coast was populated by many small hands of hunter-gatherers. Traces of their language may survive in the Etsi or Guan languages still spoken by a few groups along the coast and in the mountains of the region today. However, recent research suggests that agriculture became prevalent in the savanna to the north as far back as ca. 1700 B.C.E.‚ and over the next two millennia foraging slowly gave way to a more settled way of life in the forest zone of the Gold Coast, where ﬁrst yams, and later cassava and plantains, became the staple foods of dense populations.<br/><br/>In the ﬁfteenth century (ca. 1440 C.E.), the period from which emerge the oldest surviving written sources for the forest region that we know as the Gold Coast, large-scale, organized societies that subsisted on agriculture—and which produced enough of a surplus to support a specialized labor force—developed. The people in these societies spoke languages that later developed into the modern languages of southern Ghana—Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, and especially the Akan family of Twi languages (Fame, Akuapem, and Asante). It was the Twi-speaking Akan people who came dominate the area discussed in this story. Like many of their neighbors, the Akan organized themselves over several centuries into a society that had several major institutions. The most important of these was and remains the abusua, or extended family. The abusua institution probably developed in order to organize shared family labor for big tasks like clearing forests to plant crops, and also in order to promote the fertility of the community. The asafo was a way for a large group to provide resources to members in need, especially child-rearing women and also children. These large-scale groups were (and remain) largely organized along the lines of matrilineality. In other words, every individual is a member of a particular abusua through his or her mother and not his or her father. In fact, however, abusua membership is often assimilative, with people being brought in from outside the group as members. In fact, one feature of slavery in the region in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was the assimilation of captives into full membership of the asafo.<br/><br/>In addition to the abusua, Akan societies also developed the oman (plural: aman), or states ruled by chiefs and kings chosen from within leading abusua. The chief, or ohene (plural: abenfo) of an oman could often exercise a great deal of power, but his actions usually were also monitored, and sometimes overturned, by leading men and women of the community who served as advisors, judges, priests, and even legislators.<br/><br/>From at least the seventeenth century, as well, the common people of the community found a way to participate in the politics of the community and the oman through the development of the asafo. These brotherhoods (and possibly sisterhoods) organized people into groups for community labor, defense, ﬁreﬁghting, and other tasks, but they also came to play a role in politics by sometimes opposing the power of the chiefs. In short, Akan society was organized into states, families, and brotherhoods. The people did not live in tribes, a term commonly misapplied to the region. Nor were the chiefs arbitrary or despotic rulers. Rather, their power was checked by institutions that represented different classes and communities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

          <b>SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES: ÄSANTE AND THE EUROPEANS (101-103)</b> Two important changes after the sixteenth century complicated Akan society. The ﬁrst was the rise of the state of Asante (sometimes called Ashanti) around 1700. Centered several hundred miles north of the coastline, Asante began as a confederation of allied aman whose leading families organized for self-defense but whose armies soon defeated many surrounding states and slowly grew to control the valuable gold and kola trades in the region. Later, they also became a powerful force in the slave trade. By the late eighteenth century, the Asante Confederation was organized under a single ruling abusua and it loosely controlled the zone extending from the coast to deep into the interior—roughly the same area as the state of Ghana today.<br/><br/><br/>The other important political change of this period was the emergence of Europeans as political players on the coast. Portuguese merchants had arrived in the region as early as 1471 with charters from their king to pursue the trade in gold. They quickly made an alliance with the rulers of the town of Elmina, close to Cape Coast. They were followed by the Dutch in the 1590s, and soon after the English, French, Danish, Swedish, and even German traders. However, for several centuries local rulers were able to play these Europeans off of each other and effectively limit their political reach.<br/><br/>This balance of power changed around the mid-nineteenth century. First, the development of new technologies and medicines, such as steamships and quinine, allowed the Europeans to pursue military and political power further into the interior. Second, the Industrial Revolution enabled Britain in particular to enlarge its military and commercial power to the point that it was able to eventually drive the other European powers out of the region, with the Danish (1850) and Dutch (1871-1872) being the last to leave. Finally, the emergence of palm oil as a strategic resource for the British led them to invest more energy and effort in controlling the region. Palm oil was useful for two major industrial needs—as machine lubricant and in the production of soap.<br/><br/>The main challenge the British faced was the regional supremacy of the Asante state. Ruling over the principal palm oil—producing regions and the major ports of the area, the Asante kings seemed unchallengeable. Fortu—nately for the British, however, the rulers (ahenfo) of some states (aman), including the kings of the coastal town of Cape Coast and their nearby allies, resented Asante power and were willing to assist them. In the 1850s and 18605, a series of conﬂicts broke out between the Asante and their allies on the one hand and a British-led coalition on the other. This coalition included the Fante Confederation, a traditional alliance of states in the area around Cape Coast. In the 1860s and 18705, the leaders of this Confederation largely sought independence from Asante as an independent state allied with Britain. In 1873, the British crown sent a major force to the region and, along with Fante forces and other local allies, pushed the Asante back from the coast.<br/><br/>Out of the chaos left by the Asante retreat, the British managed to create a system of agreements with local rulers that was formalized in the creation of. a Colony and a Protectorate. The Colony, where it was generally accepted that the British ruled formally, was legally limited to a few large towns like Cape Coast, which could by controlled by the large forts that had served for generations as defensive establishments and for holding slaves. The bulk of the region became the Protectorate, which included the small and large states that had supported Britain in the 1873—1874 war as well as others who had been Asante allies but were now controlled by ahenfo sympathetic to British rule. Technically, these states were independent. Nevertheless, they had to accept certain rules imposed by the British including, technically, the abolition of all slavery.<br/><br/>

          <b>The British Civilizing Mission (104-105)</b><br/><br/>That the British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide was something of an irony, since they had in previous centuries been the world’s largest slave dealers. This switch from slave trading to abolitionism in Britain in the nineteenth century reflected wider changes in British society. The Industrial Revolution that had begun in the eighteenth century had created a new middle-class society of industrialists, ﬁnanciers, and even shop owners in Britain who were wealthy but largely lacked the political clout of the old aristocracy. This class helped to fund a community of enlightenment thinkers who developed a concept of liberalism. These new ideas celebrated the hard work and free market economy of the middle class, and allowed them to represent these values as more virtuous than those of the aristocrats, many of whom were slave owners. It was a religious as well as secular ideology, including the notion of evangelizing, or convincing others to live according to their values. It was also a useful political ideology, allowing the middle class to see themselves as more deserving of governing the country than the upper classes whom they were seeking to replace. In the late eighteenth century, the British middle class turned this ideology upon their own working classes as a sort of propaganda campaign, trying to convince them to support the middle classes and to aspire to live like them.<br/><br/>This internal campaign became international in the early nineteenth century as members of the British middle class arrived at the notion that not only were they the superior class in society, but also as a nation the most “civilized” people of the world. Thus the duty to convince the lower classes to envy and support the middle classes in Britain morphed into the concept that the British had a duty to bring their values and “civilization” to everyone else. This “civilization” included Christian evangelism, a belief in free trade and free labor rather than slavery, and support for democratic ideals. It was a powerful set of ideals that found expression in the famous words of one of the great architects of the empire, Joseph Chamberlain:<blockquote>We feel now that our rule over these territories can only be justiﬁed if we can show that it adds to the happiness and prosperity of the people, and I maintain that our rule does, and has, brought security and peace and comparative prosperity to countries that never knew these blessings before. In carrying out this work of civilization we are fulﬁlling what I believe to be our national mission, and we are finding scope for the exercise of these faculties and qualities which have made in almost every instance in which of us a great governing race . . . the rule of the Queen has been established . . . there has come with it greater security to life and property, and a material improvement in the condition of the bulk of the population.—]oseph Chamberlain, Speech to the Royal Colonial Institute, London, 31 March, 1897.</blockquote>Were the British justiﬁed in believing that they were more civilized than others, and that they therefore had a right to force or cajole other people to live in ways acceptable to the British middle class? Ironically, while the civilizing mission included a message of “democracy” and freedom, it also found ways to depict Africans and others as being unworthy of self—rule and self-determination. In Britain, the new enlightenment ideology had excluded certain groups—children, those deemed insane or criminal, and women, for example—from enjoying equality. Instead, these groups were to be “protected” and watched over by the male head of household or the British state, which was seen as sort of a national father ﬁgure. By the mid-nineteenth century, similar language was being applied in the colonies, where Africans, South Asians, and others were spoken of as being “child-like,” “savages,” or “feminine” and thus unworthy of full participation or rights. By the 18708, when Abina lived, these ideas were supported by a pseudoscientiﬁc language of racism that sought to scientifically justify their permanent exclusion from rights and thus Britain’s rule of the colonies. At the same time, however, it must be recognized that many British administrators, missionaries, and others still truly believed that they were acting in the best interests of their. African “wards.”<br/><br/>

          <b>The Civilizing Mission in the Gold Coast (105-106)</b><br/><br/>Within the Gold Coast, this sense was reflected partly in the drive by British administrators to try to reorganize local communities along the lines of British, middle-class society. This was especially pronounced in the Colony and specifically the town of Cape Coast. Once ruled by the larger oman of Fetu, Cape Coast had achieved its independence in the eighteenth century by exploiting the wealth of its merchants earned through trade with Europeans. But this self-rule was short-lived, as first Asante and later Britain came to claim the town. The British sought to impose new rules on the city, including British-style housing, straight roads, new decision-making bodies, and rules about what behavior was acceptable in the city. In order to pay for these projects, they tried to raise revenues through taxation. The rulers of Cape Coast did not always accept these measures without protest. In 1844, the leading asafo signed a protest against a British tax. Then in 1865 John Aggrey, the king of Oguaa (the Fante state in which Cape Coast was located) got into a conflict with the British administrator over who had the right to imprison criminals. He was replaced by the British, who ignored widespread protests.<br/><br/>Despite these conflicts, Europeans and Africans interacted relatively freely in the town on a day-to-day basis. By the 18705 Cape Coast contained a large population of English-speaking Africans and Euro-Africans of mixed heritage. Many of these individuals formed a class of professionals and merchants. who were generally supportive of British attitudes, traded and worked with the British administrators and commercial companies, and saw themselves as at least partly British in identity. It was these men who tried to create European—style but independent states such as the Accra Confederation and who wrote a constitution for the Fante Confederation of 1873. Many of their attitudes were reflected in newspapers meant to serve these English—speaking West Africans, like the African Times, whose Sierra Leonean editor in 1872 described himself as follows:<br/><br/>A strenuous upholder of British influence and rule on the West coast of Africa as being the only one possible under which the spread of civilization and Christianity, and a large development of material resources, could ever he effected—African Times, Feb 28, 1872, p. 94.<br/><br/>However, such attitudes did not necessarily extend to the lower classes of Cape Coast, and even less so to the population of the Protectorate territories beyond its walls. Even the greatest supporters of British “civilization” often resented the realities of British rule, and administrators faced opposition to many of their actions throughout this era.<br/><br/>

        <div class="footnote" id="[6]">
          <b>Slavery in the Gold Coast (106-107)</b><br/><br/>In the mid-1870s, an appreciable proportion of that Protectorate population was made up of people whom we can label slat/es, although that label is somewhat imprecise. A more accurate picture of enslavement in the region must include an historical account that ties it to the history and societies of the region.<br/><br/>Through written, oral, and archaeological sources we know that the Akan and their neighbors had developed a variety of social statuses in the period leading up to the sixteenth century. These can be understood partly by looking again at the various institutions of their societies. For example, individual’s identities and access to resources were tied to their membership in an extended family (abusua). What happened to people who were kicked out of their abusua for crimes or transgressions, or whose abusua broke apart due to famine or warfare? Such individuals often came to be attached to new abusua, but often without the rights and privileges of regular members. Although they might carry out the same types of labor as full members of the family, they did not enjoy the same social status or protections, and certainly not the same ability to move around. These individuals might therefore be called slaves with some accuracy.<br/><br/>Similarly, the fact that ahenfo—chiefs—and other leading men were limited in their power by a web of elders and family obligations meant that if they wished to exert their own personal power, they had to ﬁnd helpers and dependents who were not loyal to any single abusua but rather to them personally. One way to accomplish this was to create a class of “royal slaves." These individuals had become slaves through the breakup of their families or through warfare and kidnapping, and thus were at the bottom of the social ladder. Yet once they came to serve a chief they often could become quite powerful as warriors, bureaucrats, and advisors. Nevertheless, they too were dependent upon the chiefs and had restricted rights.<br/><br/>Several observations can be made about these Akan institutions that are often grouped under the term slavery. First, in contrast to plantation slavery in the Americas, Akan “slavery” was not necessarily or primarily economic, but rather political and social. Slaves may have worked as agricultural laborers and gold miners, but they usually did so alongside the families and individuals to whom they belonged. Second, slavery of this sort remained very limited until the late seventeenth century. Finally, slavery in the Gold Coast was generally assimilative, in that the enslaved could become full members of the society—and even family—in which they lived over the course of their lives or perhaps a few generations.<br/><br/>

        <div class="footnote" id="[7]">
          <b>The Atlantic Slave Trade and Abolition (107-108)</b><br/><br/>The Atlantic slave trade changed this gradually but dramatically. We can begin to trace these changes to the seventeenth century, for although some inhabitants of the region were enslaved and carried to the Americas as early as the 1500s, it was not until the 1670s that Europeans really saw the Gold Coast as a place to obtain slaves. Around that date—the height of sugar demand in Europe—Europeans became willing to pay very high prices for African laborers to work in the sugar plantations of Brazil, Louisiana, and the Caribbean. As a result, individuals in the Gold Coast willing to provide European slavers with captives could reap enormous profits. By the 1790s, European and American slave traders were embarking about 74,000 enslaved Africans per year from the region. Some large states, like Asante, became key providers of captives. Many of these were obtained from deep in the interior, where Asante armies captured entire communities and forced weaker states to provide enslaved youths as tribute to the Asante crown. In their greed, some chiefs and other Africans also changed the laws and norms of their societies to find ways to sell their own people as slaves. Such “crimes” as defaulting on a debt or committing adultery became punishable by enslavement and sale in some cases. At the same time, European and American ideas of slavery as a permanent institution became prevalent in the Gold Coast, especially as some coastal Africans began to use slaves to produce grain, palm oil, and other products on large farms for sale to Europeans.<br/><br/>Most of the Africans sold into the Atlantic slave trade from this region were men. Not only did American buyers prefer males, but also powerful Africans preferred to retain women (whom they perceived as harder workers and potential wives) within their societies. Thus slavery came more and more to be a “female” condition in the region. When the British banned the slave trade in 1807, and later criminalized slavery in the newly created Colony and Protectorate in 1874, this trend increased. There were several reasons for this, but the main one was that women were seen as being less able to run away or to report their masters and mistresses to the British.<br/><br/>In fact, most British administrators were uninterested in truly eliminating slavery in the region. Although many of them can be loosely called abolitionists, they were in reality opposed to actively rooting out slavery for several reasons. First, they recognized that the wealth of the colony and its political stability relied on their alliance with local men who were slave owners, and did not wish to alienate this class. Second, they feared that actively liberating enslaved people would cause chaos, which they wished to avoid. Finally, they convinced themselves that slavery in the region was “not that bad” and more like a parent—child relationship than plantation slavery in the Americas.<br/><br/>As a result, the laws banning slavery that came into effect in 1875 made it possible for any slave to liberate himself or herself, but did not call for British administrators to actively pursue slave owners or free slaves. This placed the burden on the enslaved to go through a number of difficult steps to liberate himself or herself, slowing down the process of emancipation immensely. It also led to the perception among slave owners that adults, especially men, would make bad slaves since they were most likely to be able to run away, go to court, or otherwise escape. Thus, after 1875, more and more children, especially girls, were enslaved outside the Colony and Protectorate and brought in to serve as slaves.<br/><br/>For these young Africans, achieving liberation was: a difficult process. It entailed running away to a society about which they knew very little and where they knew few people, searching out a British magistrate or some other protector who probably cared little about them and whose life and viewpoints were unintelligible, and somehow obtaining their aid. That some of them still managed to do so is an incredible story.<br/><br/>

        <div class="footnote" id="[8]">
          <b>Abina Mansah and the Important Men (109-111)</b><br/><br/>Abina Mansah was one of these young girls. From her testimony, we know quite a bit about her life before she became the “property” of Quamina Eddoo. We know that she had been captured or kidnapped in Asante territory, and enslaved at two residences in Asante, ﬁrst in the capital city of Coomassie [Kumasi] at the home of Eddoo Buffoe and then again in the Asante province of Adansi [Adansel (see Map 4). At some point, she was then purchased by a trader named Yowawhah [Yaw Awoah] and traveled with him to the town of Salt Pond, not far from Cape Coast and legally within the borders of the Colony. In Salt Pond, Yowawhah then appears to have secretly sold her to Quamina Eddoo, who turned her over to his sister Eccoah. After several weeks, she was told that she was to marry Tandoe, at which point she ran away to her “countrypeople” in Cape Coast—probably others from the region of Asante in which she had been born. They in turn led her to Davis, who helped her to appear before the court.<br/><br/>Most of this story revolves around Abina’s relationship to four important men—Quamina Eddoo, William Melton, James Davis, and James Hutton Brew. Davis played a pivotal role in helping Abina, not only because he seems to have taken her into his care (under conditions about which we know no details), but also because he became her attorney in the courtroom. Much of what is written about Davis in this story is a composite of evidence about other young men like him. As a court interpreter, Davis was likely educated at a mission school whose curriculum would have included English. He also spoke several other languages. He could write, and was likely a Christian. He probably was of mixed heritage, with at least one European ancestor. Although at the bottom of the middle classes of Cape Coast, Davis was employed, seems to have been related to an important local merchant family, and understood how to speak the language of the court and appeal to the morality of the judge.<br/><br/>That judge was William Melton, a minor career ofﬁcial of the British Colonial Ofﬁce. In fact, we don’t know that much about Melton, although it’s likely that his papers exist somewhere in Britain and that further research in the British archives could tell us more about him. Melton was not trained as a judge, but in his capacity as judge he was reasonably fair, at least as far as cases involving enslavement were concerned. He ruled in favor of plaintiffs who claimed to have been enslaved almost as often as in favor of their alleged masters, and frequently turned to local advisors to help him in his decisions. Unfortunately, those advisors and jurors tended to be powerful men who were sympathetic to slave ownership and not to young, female slaves.<br/><br/>We have imagined Melton’s positions in this graphic history based partly on the record of his decisions and partly on a profile of other minor officials serving on the Gold Coast during this period. Most were evangelical Christians from the British middle classes who spent only a short time in each of several overseas colonies and who believed in a paternalistic sense of fathers both as wielding great power and sacred responsibility within the family. They applied this belief both to African men, whom they trusted more than women and children, and to the British Empire as the “father” of Africans generally. Because of this worldview, they often believed that slaves could be legitimately described as “wards,” “apprentices,” “foster” children, or even “wives,” and frequently declined to liberate them or to punish the owners unless physical abuse could be proved or the evidence was beyond dispute. Even so, it must be noted that in Britain some physical punishment of children and forcing them to work was legal, and many British magistrates condoned this in the Gold Coast as well.<br/><br/>Melton seems to have been ambivalent about cases involving alleged slavery, and this was especially pronounced in this case because of the presence of James Hutton Brew. We know more about Brew than any other person in this story. The only trained lawyer among the “important men” with whom Abina interacted, Brew was the descendant of a Scottish merchant who had married into a powerful local family of chiefs and traders. James Hutton Brew was related to many important local leaders, and also had strong ties to the British authorities. Yet he was also seen by some (although not Melton) as being somewhat suspect. Not only did many British of the time distrust people of mixed heritage, whom they saw as “uppity” or “polluted,” but Brew himself had been involved in a scheme called the Fante Confederation in the early 1870s. The goal of this plan was to create an independent local state around Cape Coast. While Brew and his compatriots had hoped to get British support for this state, the administration had in fact seen it as a threat and shut it down quickly, briefly imprisoning Brew and others. Yet this did not mean that Brew was anti—European. In fact, he and the other conspirators had modeled their proposed state on Britain and Germany, and his writings suggest that he truly believed that British “civilization” had much to offer Africans.<br/><br/>Brew was clearly an effective representative for Quamina Eddoo, about whom we know much less. Clearly, Eddoo was a wealthy country “gentleman” who owned many slaves and other dependents, interacted with merchants and traders, and could afford the leading lawyer in the region. Yet he was probably illiterate, and today, nobody who lives in the area of Saltpond, where he lived more than a hundred years ago, appears to know of him. Like Abina, he has virtually disappeared from history as it is written today, and thus he cannot be numbered among the “important men”—Davis, Brew, and Hutton—who dominate the proceedings of the court case that was supposedly between Eddoo and Abina.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
