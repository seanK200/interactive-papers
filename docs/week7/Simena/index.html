          <b>The Gold Coast, ca. 1876 (99-103)</b><br /><br />The Gold Coast is a name bestowed by Europeans upon a
          stretch of West Africa roughly approximating the southern half of the modern-day state of Ghana. The name
          derives from the fact that from the eighth to the sixteenth centuries (and even today) the inhabitants of the
          region extracted a great deal of gold that entered the world economy, first by crossing the Sahara Desert into
          North Africa, and later, through trade with European merchants who visited the coast. In fact, gold was only
          one of many materials in this region’s history produced by the hard work of its people and from its rich soil
          and desired by the outside world. Over the past millennium, foreigners have often come seeking their wealth
          from the soil and people of the Gold Coast, whether by trading in gold, kola nuts, palm oil, or cocoa.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[2]">
          <b>EARLY HISTORY (99-101)</b> The human presence in West Africa stretches back many thousands of years, but
          for most of that period the Gold Coast was populated by many small hands of hunter-gatherers. Traces of their
          language may survive in the Etsi or Guan languages still spoken by a few groups along the coast and in the
          mountains of the region today. However, recent research suggests that agriculture became prevalent in the
          savanna to the north as far back as ca. 1700 B.C.E.‚ and over the next two millennia foraging slowly gave way
          to a more settled way of life in the forest zone of the Gold Coast, where ﬁrst yams, and later cassava and
          plantains, became the staple foods of dense populations.<br /><br />In the ﬁfteenth century (ca. 1440 C.E.),
          the period from which emerge the oldest surviving written sources for the forest region that we know as the
          Gold Coast, large-scale, organized societies that subsisted on agriculture—and which produced enough of a
          surplus to support a specialized labor force—developed. The people in these societies spoke languages that
          later developed into the modern languages of southern Ghana—Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, and especially the Akan family of
          Twi languages (Fame, Akuapem, and Asante). It was the Twi-speaking Akan people who came dominate the area
          discussed in this story. Like many of their neighbors, the Akan organized themselves over several centuries
          into a society that had several major institutions. The most important of these was and remains the abusua, or
          extended family. The abusua institution probably developed in order to organize shared family labor for big
          tasks like clearing forests to plant crops, and also in order to promote the fertility of the community. The
          asafo was a way for a large group to provide resources to members in need, especially child-rearing women and
          also children. These large-scale groups were (and remain) largely organized along the lines of matrilineality.
          In other words, every individual is a member of a particular abusua through his or her mother and not his or
          her father. In fact, however, abusua membership is often assimilative, with people being brought in from
          outside the group as members. In fact, one feature of slavery in the region in the eighteenth and early
          nineteenth centuries was the assimilation of captives into full membership of the asafo.<br /><br />In
          addition to the abusua, Akan societies also developed the oman (plural: aman), or states ruled by chiefs and
          kings chosen from within leading abusua. The chief, or ohene (plural: abenfo) of an oman could often exercise
          a great deal of power, but his actions usually were also monitored, and sometimes overturned, by leading men
          and women of the community who served as advisors, judges, priests, and even legislators.<br /><br />From at
          least the seventeenth century, as well, the common people of the community found a way to participate in the
          politics of the community and the oman through the development of the asafo. These brotherhoods (and possibly
          sisterhoods) organized people into groups for community labor, defense, ﬁreﬁghting, and other tasks, but they
          also came to play a role in politics by sometimes opposing the power of the chiefs. In short, Akan society was
          organized into states, families, and brotherhoods. The people did not live in tribes, a term commonly
          misapplied to the region. Nor were the chiefs arbitrary or despotic rulers. Rather, their power was checked by
          institutions that represented different classes and communities.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        <div class="footnote" id="[3]">
          <b>SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES: ÄSANTE AND THE EUROPEANS (101-103)</b> Two important changes after the
          sixteenth century complicated Akan society. The ﬁrst was the rise of the state of Asante (sometimes called
          Ashanti) around 1700. Centered several hundred miles north of the coastline, Asante began as a confederation
          of allied aman whose leading families organized for self-defense but whose armies soon defeated many
          surrounding states and slowly grew to control the valuable gold and kola trades in the region. Later, they
          also became a powerful force in the slave trade. By the late eighteenth century, the Asante Confederation was
          organized under a single ruling abusua and it loosely controlled the zone extending from the coast to deep
          into the interior—roughly the same area as the state of Ghana today.<br /><br /><br />The other important
          political change of this period was the emergence of Europeans as political players on the coast. Portuguese
          merchants had arrived in the region as early as 1471 with charters from their king to pursue the trade in
          gold. They quickly made an alliance with the rulers of the town of Elmina, close to Cape Coast. They were
          followed by the Dutch in the 1590s, and soon after the English, French, Danish, Swedish, and even German
          traders. However, for several centuries local rulers were able to play these Europeans off of each other and
          effectively limit their political reach.<br /><br />This balance of power changed around the mid-nineteenth
          century. First, the development of new technologies and medicines, such as steamships and quinine, allowed the
          Europeans to pursue military and political power further into the interior. Second, the Industrial Revolution
          enabled Britain in particular to enlarge its military and commercial power to the point that it was able to
          eventually drive the other European powers out of the region, with the Danish (1850) and Dutch (1871-1872)
          being the last to leave. Finally, the emergence of palm oil as a strategic resource for the British led them
          to invest more energy and effort in controlling the region. Palm oil was useful for two major industrial
          needs—as machine lubricant and in the production of soap.<br /><br />The main challenge the British faced was
          the regional supremacy of the Asante state. Ruling over the principal palm oil—producing regions and the major
          ports of the area, the Asante kings seemed unchallengeable. Fortu—nately for the British, however, the rulers
          (ahenfo) of some states (aman), including the kings of the coastal town of Cape Coast and their nearby allies,
          resented Asante power and were willing to assist them. In the 1850s and 18605, a series of conﬂicts broke out
          between the Asante and their allies on the one hand and a British-led coalition on the other. This coalition
          included the Fante Confederation, a traditional alliance of states in the area around Cape Coast. In the 1860s
          and 18705, the leaders of this Confederation largely sought independence from Asante as an independent state
          allied with Britain. In 1873, the British crown sent a major force to the region and, along with Fante forces
          and other local allies, pushed the Asante back from the coast.<br /><br />Out of the chaos left by the Asante
          retreat, the British managed to create a system of agreements with local rulers that was formalized in the
          creation of. a Colony and a Protectorate. The Colony, where it was generally accepted that the British ruled
          formally, was legally limited to a few large towns like Cape Coast, which could by controlled by the large
          forts that had served for generations as defensive establishments and for holding slaves. The bulk of the
          region became the Protectorate, which included the small and large states that had supported Britain in the
          1873—1874 war as well as others who had been Asante allies but were now controlled by ahenfo sympathetic to
          British rule. Technically, these states were independent. Nevertheless, they had to accept certain rules
          imposed by the British including, technically, the abolition of all slavery.<br /><br />

        <div class="footnote" id="[4]">
          <b>The British Civilizing Mission (104-105)</b><br /><br />That the British were, by the late eighteenth
          century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide was something of an irony, since they
          had in previous centuries been the world’s largest slave dealers. This switch from slave trading to
          abolitionism in Britain in the nineteenth century reflected wider changes in British society. The Industrial
          Revolution that had begun in the eighteenth century had created a new middle-class society of industrialists,
          ﬁnanciers, and even shop owners in Britain who were wealthy but largely lacked the political clout of the old
          aristocracy. This class helped to fund a community of enlightenment thinkers who developed a concept of
          liberalism. These new ideas celebrated the hard work and free market economy of the middle class, and allowed
          them to represent these values as more virtuous than those of the aristocrats, many of whom were slave owners.
          It was a religious as well as secular ideology, including the notion of evangelizing, or convincing others to
          live according to their values. It was also a useful political ideology, allowing the middle class to see
          themselves as more deserving of governing the country than the upper classes whom they were seeking to
          replace. In the late eighteenth century, the British middle class turned this ideology upon their own working
          classes as a sort of propaganda campaign, trying to convince them to support the middle classes and to aspire
          to live like them.<br /><br />This internal campaign became international in the early nineteenth century as
          members of the British middle class arrived at the notion that not only were they the superior class in
          society, but also as a nation the most “civilized” people of the world. Thus the duty to convince the lower
          classes to envy and support the middle classes in Britain morphed into the concept that the British had a duty
          to bring their values and “civilization” to everyone else. This “civilization” included Christian evangelism,
          a belief in free trade and free labor rather than slavery, and support for democratic ideals. It was a
          powerful set of ideals that found expression in the famous words of one of the great architects of the empire,
          Joseph Chamberlain:
          <blockquote>
            We feel now that our rule over these territories can only be justiﬁed if we can show that it adds to the
            happiness and prosperity of the people, and I maintain that our rule does, and has, brought security and
            peace and comparative prosperity to countries that never knew these blessings before. In carrying out this
            work of civilization we are fulﬁlling what I believe to be our national mission, and we are finding scope
            for the exercise of these faculties and qualities which have made in almost every instance in which of us a
            great governing race . . . the rule of the Queen has been established . . . there has come with it greater
            security to life and property, and a material improvement in the condition of the bulk of the
            population.—]oseph Chamberlain, Speech to the Royal Colonial Institute, London, 31 March, 1897.
          </blockquote>
          Were the British justiﬁed in believing that they were more civilized than others, and that they therefore had
          a right to force or cajole other people to live in ways acceptable to the British middle class? Ironically,
          while the civilizing mission included a message of “democracy” and freedom, it also found ways to depict
          Africans and others as being unworthy of self—rule and self-determination. In Britain, the new enlightenment
          ideology had excluded certain groups—children, those deemed insane or criminal, and women, for example—from
          enjoying equality. Instead, these groups were to be “protected” and watched over by the male head of household
          or the British state, which was seen as sort of a national father ﬁgure. By the mid-nineteenth century,
          similar language was being applied in the colonies, where Africans, South Asians, and others were spoken of as
          being “child-like,” “savages,” or “feminine” and thus unworthy of full participation or rights. By the 18708,
          when Abina lived, these ideas were supported by a pseudoscientiﬁc language of racism that sought to
          scientifically justify their permanent exclusion from rights and thus Britain’s rule of the colonies. At the
          same time, however, it must be recognized that many British administrators, missionaries, and others still
          truly believed that they were acting in the best interests of their. African “wards.”<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[5]">
          <b>The Civilizing Mission in the Gold Coast (105-106)</b><br /><br />Within the Gold Coast, this sense was
          reflected partly in the drive by British administrators to try to reorganize local communities along the lines
          of British, middle-class society. This was especially pronounced in the Colony and specifically the town of
          Cape Coast. Once ruled by the larger oman of Fetu, Cape Coast had achieved its independence in the eighteenth
          century by exploiting the wealth of its merchants earned through trade with Europeans. But this self-rule was
          short-lived, as first Asante and later Britain came to claim the town. The British sought to impose new rules
          on the city, including British-style housing, straight roads, new decision-making bodies, and rules about what
          behavior was acceptable in the city. In order to pay for these projects, they tried to raise revenues through
          taxation. The rulers of Cape Coast did not always accept these measures without protest. In 1844, the leading
          asafo signed a protest against a British tax. Then in 1865 John Aggrey, the king of Oguaa (the Fante state in
          which Cape Coast was located) got into a conflict with the British administrator over who had the right to
          imprison criminals. He was replaced by the British, who ignored widespread protests.<br /><br />Despite these
          conflicts, Europeans and Africans interacted relatively freely in the town on a day-to-day basis. By the 18705
          Cape Coast contained a large population of English-speaking Africans and Euro-Africans of mixed heritage. Many
          of these individuals formed a class of professionals and merchants. who were generally supportive of British
          attitudes, traded and worked with the British administrators and commercial companies, and saw themselves as
          at least partly British in identity. It was these men who tried to create European—style but independent
          states such as the Accra Confederation and who wrote a constitution for the Fante Confederation of 1873. Many
          of their attitudes were reflected in newspapers meant to serve these English—speaking West Africans, like the
          African Times, whose Sierra Leonean editor in 1872 described himself as follows:<br /><br />A strenuous
          upholder of British influence and rule on the West coast of Africa as being the only one possible under which
          the spread of civilization and Christianity, and a large development of material resources, could ever he
          effected—African Times, Feb 28, 1872, p. 94.<br /><br />However, such attitudes did not necessarily extend to
          the lower classes of Cape Coast, and even less so to the population of the Protectorate territories beyond its
          walls. Even the greatest supporters of British “civilization” often resented the realities of British rule,
          and administrators faced opposition to many of their actions throughout this era.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div class="footnote" id="[6]">
          <b>Slavery in the Gold Coast (106-107)</b><br /><br />In the mid-1870s, an appreciable proportion of that
          Protectorate population was made up of people whom we can label slat/es, although that label is somewhat
          imprecise. A more accurate picture of enslavement in the region must include an historical account that ties
          it to the history and societies of the region.<br /><br />Through written, oral, and archaeological sources we
          know that the Akan and their neighbors had developed a variety of social statuses in the period leading up to
          the sixteenth century. These can be understood partly by looking again at the various institutions of their
          societies. For example, individual’s identities and access to resources were tied to their membership in an
          extended family (abusua). What happened to people who were kicked out of their abusua for crimes or
          transgressions, or whose abusua broke apart due to famine or warfare? Such individuals often came to be
          attached to new abusua, but often without the rights and privileges of regular members. Although they might
          carry out the same types of labor as full members of the family, they did not enjoy the same social status or
          protections, and certainly not the same ability to move around. These individuals might therefore be called
          slaves with some accuracy.<br /><br />Similarly, the fact that ahenfo—chiefs—and other leading men were
          limited in their power by a web of elders and family obligations meant that if they wished to exert their own
          personal power, they had to ﬁnd helpers and dependents who were not loyal to any single abusua but rather to
          them personally. One way to accomplish this was to create a class of “royal slaves." These individuals had
          become slaves through the breakup of their families or through warfare and kidnapping, and thus were at the
          bottom of the social ladder. Yet once they came to serve a chief they often could become quite powerful as
          warriors, bureaucrats, and advisors. Nevertheless, they too were dependent upon the chiefs and had restricted
          rights.<br /><br />Several observations can be made about these Akan institutions that are often grouped under
          the term slavery. First, in contrast to plantation slavery in the Americas, Akan “slavery” was not necessarily
          or primarily economic, but rather political and social. Slaves may have worked as agricultural laborers and
          gold miners, but they usually did so alongside the families and individuals to whom they belonged. Second,
          slavery of this sort remained very limited until the late seventeenth century. Finally, slavery in the Gold
          Coast was generally assimilative, in that the enslaved could become full members of the society—and even
          family—in which they lived over the course of their lives or perhaps a few generations.<br /><br />

          <b>The Atlantic Slave Trade and Abolition (107-108)</b><br /><br />The Atlantic slave trade changed this
          gradually but dramatically. We can begin to trace these changes to the seventeenth century, for although some
          inhabitants of the region were enslaved and carried to the Americas as early as the 1500s, it was not until
          the 1670s that Europeans really saw the Gold Coast as a place to obtain slaves. Around that date—the height of
          sugar demand in Europe—Europeans became willing to pay very high prices for African laborers to work in the
          sugar plantations of Brazil, Louisiana, and the Caribbean. As a result, individuals in the Gold Coast willing
          to provide European slavers with captives could reap enormous profits. By the 1790s, European and American
          slave traders were embarking about 74,000 enslaved Africans per year from the region. Some large states, like
          Asante, became key providers of captives. Many of these were obtained from deep in the interior, where Asante
          armies captured entire communities and forced weaker states to provide enslaved youths as tribute to the
          Asante crown. In their greed, some chiefs and other Africans also changed the laws and norms of their
          societies to find ways to sell their own people as slaves. Such “crimes” as defaulting on a debt or committing
          adultery became punishable by enslavement and sale in some cases. At the same time, European and American
          ideas of slavery as a permanent institution became prevalent in the Gold Coast, especially as some coastal
          Africans began to use slaves to produce grain, palm oil, and other products on large farms for sale to
          Europeans.<br /><br />Most of the Africans sold into the Atlantic slave trade from this region were men. Not
          only did American buyers prefer males, but also powerful Africans preferred to retain women (whom they
          perceived as harder workers and potential wives) within their societies. Thus slavery came more and more to be
          a “female” condition in the region. When the British banned the slave trade in 1807, and later criminalized
          slavery in the newly created Colony and Protectorate in 1874, this trend increased. There were several reasons
          for this, but the main one was that women were seen as being less able to run away or to report their masters
          and mistresses to the British.<br /><br />In fact, most British administrators were uninterested in truly
          eliminating slavery in the region. Although many of them can be loosely called abolitionists, they were in
          reality opposed to actively rooting out slavery for several reasons. First, they recognized that the wealth of
          the colony and its political stability relied on their alliance with local men who were slave owners, and did
          not wish to alienate this class. Second, they feared that actively liberating enslaved people would cause
          chaos, which they wished to avoid. Finally, they convinced themselves that slavery in the region was “not that
          bad” and more like a parent—child relationship than plantation slavery in the Americas.<br /><br />As a
          result, the laws banning slavery that came into effect in 1875 made it possible for any slave to liberate
          himself or herself, but did not call for British administrators to actively pursue slave owners or free
          slaves. This placed the burden on the enslaved to go through a number of difficult steps to liberate himself
          or herself, slowing down the process of emancipation immensely. It also led to the perception among slave
          owners that adults, especially men, would make bad slaves since they were most likely to be able to run away,
          go to court, or otherwise escape. Thus, after 1875, more and more children, especially girls, were enslaved
          outside the Colony and Protectorate and brought in to serve as slaves.<br /><br />For these young Africans,
          achieving liberation was: a difficult process. It entailed running away to a society about which they knew
          very little and where they knew few people, searching out a British magistrate or some other protector who
          probably cared little about them and whose life and viewpoints were unintelligible, and somehow obtaining
          their aid. That some of them still managed to do so is an incredible story.<br /><br />

        <div class="footnote" id="[8]">
          <b>Abina Mansah and the Important Men (109-111)</b><br /><br />Abina Mansah was one of these young girls. From
          her testimony, we know quite a bit about her life before she became the “property” of Quamina Eddoo. We know
          that she had been captured or kidnapped in Asante territory, and enslaved at two residences in Asante, ﬁrst in
          the capital city of Coomassie [Kumasi] at the home of Eddoo Buffoe and then again in the Asante province of
          Adansi [Adansel (see Map 4). At some point, she was then purchased by a trader named Yowawhah [Yaw Awoah] and
          traveled with him to the town of Salt Pond, not far from Cape Coast and legally within the borders of the
          Colony. In Salt Pond, Yowawhah then appears to have secretly sold her to Quamina Eddoo, who turned her over to
          his sister Eccoah. After several weeks, she was told that she was to marry Tandoe, at which point she ran away
          to her “countrypeople” in Cape Coast—probably others from the region of Asante in which she had been born.
          They in turn led her to Davis, who helped her to appear before the court.<br /><br />Most of this story
          revolves around Abina’s relationship to four important men—Quamina Eddoo, William Melton, James Davis, and
          James Hutton Brew. Davis played a pivotal role in helping Abina, not only because he seems to have taken her
          into his care (under conditions about which we know no details), but also because he became her attorney in
          the courtroom. Much of what is written about Davis in this story is a composite of evidence about other young
          men like him. As a court interpreter, Davis was likely educated at a mission school whose curriculum would
          have included English. He also spoke several other languages. He could write, and was likely a Christian. He
          probably was of mixed heritage, with at least one European ancestor. Although at the bottom of the middle
          classes of Cape Coast, Davis was employed, seems to have been related to an important local merchant family,
          and understood how to speak the language of the court and appeal to the morality of the judge.<br /><br />That
          judge was William Melton, a minor career ofﬁcial of the British Colonial Ofﬁce. In fact, we don’t know that
          much about Melton, although it’s likely that his papers exist somewhere in Britain and that further research
          in the British archives could tell us more about him. Melton was not trained as a judge, but in his capacity
          as judge he was reasonably fair, at least as far as cases involving enslavement were concerned. He ruled in
          favor of plaintiffs who claimed to have been enslaved almost as often as in favor of their alleged masters,
          and frequently turned to local advisors to help him in his decisions. Unfortunately, those advisors and jurors
          tended to be powerful men who were sympathetic to slave ownership and not to young, female slaves.<br /><br />We
          have imagined Melton’s positions in this graphic history based partly on the record of his decisions and
          partly on a profile of other minor officials serving on the Gold Coast during this period. Most were
          evangelical Christians from the British middle classes who spent only a short time in each of several overseas
          colonies and who believed in a paternalistic sense of fathers both as wielding great power and sacred
          responsibility within the family. They applied this belief both to African men, whom they trusted more than
          women and children, and to the British Empire as the “father” of Africans generally. Because of this
          worldview, they often believed that slaves could be legitimately described as “wards,” “apprentices,” “foster”
          children, or even “wives,” and frequently declined to liberate them or to punish the owners unless physical
          abuse could be proved or the evidence was beyond dispute. Even so, it must be noted that in Britain some
          physical punishment of children and forcing them to work was legal, and many British magistrates condoned this
          in the Gold Coast as well.<br /><br />Melton seems to have been ambivalent about cases involving alleged
          slavery, and this was especially pronounced in this case because of the presence of James Hutton Brew. We know
          more about Brew than any other person in this story. The only trained lawyer among the “important men” with
          whom Abina interacted, Brew was the descendant of a Scottish merchant who had married into a powerful local
          family of chiefs and traders. James Hutton Brew was related to many important local leaders, and also had
          strong ties to the British authorities. Yet he was also seen by some (although not Melton) as being somewhat
          suspect. Not only did many British of the time distrust people of mixed heritage, whom they saw as “uppity” or
          “polluted,” but Brew himself had been involved in a scheme called the Fante Confederation in the early 1870s.
          The goal of this plan was to create an independent local state around Cape Coast. While Brew and his
          compatriots had hoped to get British support for this state, the administration had in fact seen it as a
          threat and shut it down quickly, briefly imprisoning Brew and others. Yet this did not mean that Brew was
          anti—European. In fact, he and the other conspirators had modeled their proposed state on Britain and Germany,
          and his writings suggest that he truly believed that British “civilization” had much to offer Africans.<br /><br />Brew
          was clearly an effective representative for Quamina Eddoo, about whom we know much less. Clearly, Eddoo was a
          wealthy country “gentleman” who owned many slaves and other dependents, interacted with merchants and traders,
          and could afford the leading lawyer in the region. Yet he was probably illiterate, and today, nobody who lives
          in the area of Saltpond, where he lived more than a hundred years ago, appears to know of him. Like Abina, he
          has virtually disappeared from history as it is written today, and thus he cannot be numbered among the
          “important men”—Davis, Brew, and Hutton—who dominate the proceedings of the court case that was supposedly
          between Eddoo and Abina.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        <div class="footnote" id="If she says go for firewood, or water or to market I go. She forces me.">
            <b>(M)</b> I miss here the part where she is forced to do something. Abina repeatedly says that she is a slave and is forced to do her work, but she never says a single word about punishment or something else that would happen if she didn't cooperate.

        <div class="footnote" id="requested, solicited, or bow?">
          <b>(C)</b> I think James already knows the answer to this question, yet asks Abina to give a more concise answer.

          <div class="footnote" id="ABINA MANSAH">
            <b>(SU)</b> All of a sudden Abina states that she is free when she was previously saying she wasn't aware of her freedom.
            </div>

            <div class="footnote" id="If she said to me">
              <b>(AUTH)</b> Suddenly she changes her stance. At first, she claimed that she didn't know she was free, then claimed that she was indeed free. Why did she lie in the first place? Was this a strategic decision?
